        <div class="accordion"><i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>How long does it take to write my paper?</div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The time-frames are specified by our customer. However, we recommend to place the order for as much time as you can allow as it is not only about writing the paper but about the researching relevant materials as well.</p>

    <div class="faqs">
        <div class="accordion"><i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Can your papers pass TurnItIn detection test?</div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Starting August 2006 we have launched a module that checks any custom paper that we produce for plagiarism, be it a dissertation, coursework, thesis or a simple 5-paragraph essay. We utilize latest technologies of web search to detect plagiarized materials and guarantee 100% authentic custom written research papers. The procedure is as follows: whenever the writer uploads a completed paper to the control panel, our system starts an automatic plagiarism check in the background. The paper is separated into small blocks, called patterns. Then the system performs a web search by utilizing a so-called Rabin-Karp algorithm of string text search, thus giving the most precise results, (it even includes sources where the parts of the paper were copied from). This technology was invented back in 1987, and we found it to be the most adequate solution for our clients" needs.</p>

        <div class="accordion"><i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>How will you select my writer?</div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>We generally allow our most experienced writers to pick-up orders themselves, as long as they have the relevant qualifications. When a new order comes in, we circulate a notice to all writers in that field, and someone who is available and interested in your topic will chose to work on your project. Our junior or less experienced writers require administrators' approval before they can start on the job. Writers have competitive incentives to work towards and are well looked after, which means that we attract and retain the very best writers in this industry.</p>

        <div class="accordion"><i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>Do you guarantee 2:1 result?</div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>We can certainly provide you with a 2:1 level writing. But, because of differing standards of grading between universities (and even professors) a guarantee of grade is near impossible for any writing service, we suggest you to be careful of those that do. However, we do guarantee we will work on your paper until you are completely satisfied with it, if we don't get it right the first time we'll revise it until we do.</p>

        <div class="panel">
            <p>No, our papers are never resold or published anywhere else. Unlike many of our competitors, we do not own or operate databases of essays and dissertations. We think it is highly unethical to put reputation of our customers under question.</p>

        <div class="panel">
            <p>We charge only for the actual content. Bibliography, references, title page and footnotes are free of charge. It is easy to check: every word processing software has a function of word count. Normally, there should be around 250 words per page. This means a thousand words every four pages. So, dividing the number of words by 250 you will get the actual number of pages paid.</p>

                <h2>THE STORY OF OZESSAY</h2>
                <p>After years in the education industry, we realised that it was nearly impossible for the average student to live their life to the fullest while pursuing their degree. Academic assignments are often too complicated, time-consuming and enormous to handle.</p>
                <p>We wanted to offer a platform that would provide simple solutions to challenging issues students face on their academic path. And so, in the fall of 2005, OZessay was born. Today, we're a team of 750+ hand-selected writers, editors and proofreaders focused on creating high-quality content for students at all study levels.</p>

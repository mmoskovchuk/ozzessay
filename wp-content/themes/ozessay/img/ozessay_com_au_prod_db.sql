For example the image below has had a caption entered in the WordPress image upload dialog box, this creates a [caption] shortcode which then in turn wraps the whole thing in a <code>div</code> with inline styling!

The amount of columns in the gallery is also changable by the user, but the default is three so we\'ll work with that for our example with an added fouth image to test verticle spacing.\r\n<div id=\"gallery-1\" class=\"gallery galleryid-1 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail\"><dl class=\"gallery-item\"><dt class=\"gallery-icon\"><a title=\"Your Title\" href=\"#\"><img class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" title=\"Your Title\" src=\"http://www.wpfill.me.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/img/img_thumb.png\" alt=\"Your Alt Title\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a></dt></dl><dl class=\"gallery-item\"><dt class=\"gallery-icon\"><a title=\"Your Title\" href=\"#\"><img class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" title=\"Your Title\" src=\"http://www.wpfill.me.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/img/img_thumb.png\" alt=\"Your Alt Title\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a></dt></dl><dl class=\"gallery-item\"><dt class=\"gallery-icon\"><a title=\"Your Title\" href=\"#\"><img class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" title=\"Your Title\" src=\"http://www.wpfill.me.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/img/img_thumb.png\" alt=\"Your Alt Title\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a></dt></dl>&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<dl class=\"gallery-item\"><dt class=\"gallery-icon\"><a title=\"Your Title\" href=\"#\"><img class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" title=\"Your Title\" src=\"http://www.wpfill.me.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/img/img_thumb.png\" alt=\"Your Alt Title\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a></dt></dl>&nbsp;\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Table Head Column One</th>\r\n<th>Table Head Column Two</th>\r\n<th>Table Head Column Three</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tfoot>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Table Footer Column One</td>\r\n<td>Table Footer Column Two</td>\r\n<td>Table Footer Column Three</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tfoot>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Table Row Column One</td>\r\n<td>Short Text</td>\r\n<td>Testing a table cell with a longer amount of text to see what happens, you\'re not using tables for site layouts are you?</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Table Row Column One</td>\r\n<td>Table Row Column Two</td>\r\n<td>Table Row Column Three</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Table Row Column One</td>\r\n<td>Table Row Column Two</td>\r\n<td>Table Row Column Three</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Table Row Column One</td>\r\n<td>Table Row Column Two</td>\r\n<td>Table Row Column Three</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Table Row Column One</td>\r\n<td>Table Row Column Two</td>\r\n<td>Table Row Column Three</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Ordered list item one.</li>\r\n	<li>Ordered list item two.</li>\r\n	<li>Ordered list item three.</li>\r\n	<li>Ordered list item four.</li>\r\n	<li>By the way, Wordpress does not let you create nested lists through the visual editor.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Unordered list item one.</li>\r\n	<li>Unordered list item two.</li>\r\n	<li>Unordered list item three.</li>\r\n	<li>Unordered list item four.</li>\r\n	<li>By the way, Wordpress does not let you create nested lists through the visual editor.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<blockquote>Currently WordPress blockquotes are just wrapped in blockquote tags and have no clear way for the user to define a source.

It has a <strong>strong tag</strong>, an <em>em tag</em> and a <del>strikethrough</del> which is actually just the del element. There are a few more inline elements which are not in the WordPress admin but we should check for incase your users get busy with the copy and paste. These include <cite>citations</cite>, <abbr title=\"abbreviation\">abbr</abbr>, bits of <code>code</code> and <var>variables</var>, <q>inline quotations</q>, <ins datetime=\"2011-12-08T20:19:53+00:00\">inserted text</ins>, text that is <s>no longer accurate</s> or something <mark>so important</mark> you might want to mark it. We can also style subscript and superscript characters like C0<sub>2</sub>, here is our 2<sup>nd</sup> example. If they are feeling non-semantic they might even use <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <big>big</big> or <small>small</small> elements too. Incidentally, these HTML4.01 tags have been given new life and semantic meaning in HTML5, you may be interested in reading this <a title=\"HTML5 Semantics\" href=\"http://csswizardry.com/2011/01/html5-and-text-level-semantics\">article by Harry Roberts</a> which gives a nice excuse to test a link.  It is also worth noting in the \"kitchen sink\" view you can also add <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">underline</span> styling and set <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">text color</span> with pesky inline CSS.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Additionally, WordPress also sets text alignment with inline styles, like this left aligned paragraph. Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">This is a right aligned paragraph. Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is a justified paragraph. Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Finally, you also have the option of an indented paragraph. Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.</p>\r\nAnd last, and by no means least, users can also apply the <code>Address</code> tag to text like this:\r\n\r\n<address>123 Example Street,\r\nTestville,\r\nWest Madeupsburg,\r\nCSSland,\r\n1234</address>...so there you have it, all our text elements','Home','','inherit','closed','closed','','2-revision-v1','','','2016-12-07 12:19:17','2016-12-07 12:19:17','',2,'http://wp-test/2016/12/07/2-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(8,1,'2016-12-07 12:19:30','2016-12-07 12:19:30','','Order','','publish','closed','closed','','order','','','2016-12-07 12:19:30','2016-12-07 12:19:30','',0,'http://wp-test/?page_id=8',0,'page','',0),(9,1,'2016-12-07 12:19:30','2016-12-07 12:19:30','','Order','','inherit','closed','closed','','8-revision-v1','','','2016-12-07 12:19:30','2016-12-07 12:19:30','',8,'http://wp-test/2016/12/07/8-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(10,1,'2016-12-07 12:19:38','2016-12-07 12:19:38','','Preview','','publish','closed','closed','','preview','','','2016-12-07 12:19:38','2016-12-07 12:19:38','',0,'http://wp-test/?page_id=10',0,'page','',0),(11,1,'2016-12-07 12:19:38','2016-12-07 12:19:38','','Preview','','inherit','closed','closed','','10-revision-v1','','','2016-12-07 12:19:38','2016-12-07 12:19:38','',10,'http://wp-test/2016/12/07/10-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(12,1,'2016-12-07 12:19:46','2016-12-07 12:19:46','','Prices','','publish','closed','closed','','prices','','','2016-12-07 12:19:46','2016-12-07 12:19:46','',0,'http://wp-test/?page_id=12',0,'page','',0),(13,1,'2016-12-07 12:19:46','2016-12-07 12:19:46','','Prices','','inherit','closed','closed','','12-revision-v1','','','2016-12-07 12:19:46','2016-12-07 12:19:46','',12,'http://wp-test/2016/12/07/12-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(14,1,'2016-12-07 12:19:58','2016-12-07 12:19:58','','Terms','','publish','closed','closed','','terms','','','2016-12-07 12:19:58','2016-12-07 12:19:58','',0,'http://wp-test/?page_id=14',0,'page','',0),(15,1,'2016-12-07 12:19:58','2016-12-07 12:19:58','','Terms','','inherit','closed','closed','','14-revision-v1','','','2016-12-07 12:19:58','2016-12-07 12:19:58','',14,'http://wp-test/2016/12/07/14-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(16,3,'2018-01-29 15:31:21','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','Auto Draft','','auto-draft','closed','closed','','','','','2018-01-29 15:31:21','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://ozessay.com.au.local/?p=16',0,'post','',0),(17,3,'2018-01-30 10:43:48','2018-01-30 10:43:48',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','17','','','2018-01-30 10:43:48','2018-01-30 10:43:48','',0,'http://ozessay.com.au.local/?p=17',1,'nav_menu_item','',0),(18,3,'2018-01-30 10:43:48','2018-01-30 10:43:48',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','18','','','2018-01-30 10:43:48','2018-01-30 10:43:48','',0,'http://ozessay.com.au.local/?p=18',2,'nav_menu_item','',0),(19,3,'2018-01-30 10:43:48','2018-01-30 10:43:48',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','19','','','2018-01-30 10:43:48','2018-01-30 10:43:48','',0,'http://ozessay.com.au.local/?p=19',3,'nav_menu_item','',0),(20,3,'2018-01-30 10:43:48','2018-01-30 10:43:48',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','20','','','2018-01-30 10:43:48','2018-01-30 10:43:48','',0,'http://ozessay.com.au.local/?p=20',4,'nav_menu_item','',0),(21,3,'2018-02-01 10:23:48','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','Test','','draft','closed','closed','','','','','2018-02-01 10:23:48','2018-02-01 10:23:48','',0,'http://ozessay.com.au.local/?p=21',0,'post','',0),(22,3,'2018-02-01 10:24:02','2018-02-01 10:24:02','','test default page','','trash','closed','closed','','test-default-page__trashed','','','2018-02-01 10:59:10','2018-02-01 10:59:10','',0,'http://ozessay.com.au.local/?page_id=22',0,'page','',0),(23,3,'2018-02-01 10:24:02','2018-02-01 10:24:02','','test default page','','inherit','closed','closed','','22-revision-v1','','','2018-02-01 10:24:02','2018-02-01 10:24:02','',22,'http://ozessay.com.au.local/22-revision-v1',0,'revision','',0),(24,3,'2018-02-01 10:28:30','2018-02-01 10:28:30','','custom_essay_ozessay','','inherit','closed','closed','','custom_essay_ozessay','','','2018-02-01 10:28:30','2018-02-01 10:28:30','',22,'http://ozessay.com.au.local/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/custom_essay_ozessay.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(25,1,'2010-07-12 13:40:04','2010-07-12 10:40:04','<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>As an honest company, we feel obligated to warn you about deceptive \"term paper\" and \"essay\" Web sites. There are countless foreign websites that have infested the Internet.</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For a complete list of fraudulent websites, please visit our highly respected website of <strong>Student Network Resources.</strong>&nbsp;Text on this page contains only fragments of their descriptive consumer warning. We, however, added some paragraphs for those of you who have been a victim of fraudsters, to help you recover the losses.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Below, we explain how to identify foreign companies that provide low-quality material, and reveal many of the tricks (including ridiculously low prices) that foreign sites use to attract unsuspecting customers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Consumer Alert: </strong>During the last 6 years, the American research industry has become infested with low-quality, fraudulent, foreign companies seeking to make a quick dollar by deceiving unsuspecting customers in the United States. These bogus Web sites from <strong>Pakistan</strong>, <strong>Romania</strong>, <strong>Ukraine</strong>, and the <strong>Philippines</strong> use their suspiciously low prices and false promises to lure American students into their traps. You should never have to worry about receiving a low-quality, improperly-formatted, outdated, recycled, plagiarized paper with countless errors in spelling and grammar. In contrast, our professional, AMERICAN writers produce new papers on an individual basis, so our research materials are unique, original, technically precise, and up-to-date. The information below explains why you MUST AVOID all foreign sites, subscription sites, membership sites, free sites, and database sites.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many of these foreign outfits have read this warning page, and now falsely claim to be \"American\" and/or employ \"only American writers with master or doctoral degrees.\" Do not believe their obvious lies! No professional writer in the United States of America, Australia, New Zealand or the United Kingdom would work on an MBA-level project for less than $12.00 per page in compensation, yet most of these foreign sites charge CUSTOMERS as little as $6.95-$9.95 per page. That means their writers are getting paid only $0.75-$3.00 per page! Obviously, these amateurs, English-as-a-Second-Language writers are located in very poor countries where the American dollar has much greater value (Pakistan, India, Philippines, Nigeria, Romania, etc.).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It can be very difficult for customers to find honest companies amongst the hundreds of foreign and low-quality \"essay\" and \"term paper\" sites. Many services are operated by amateur teenagers out of their bedrooms, or unskilled laborers in countries such as Romania, Pakistan, Ukraine, and India. Of course, the owners of these sites CLAIM that they operate \"an American business\" and/or that their writers are \"English speakers with master and doctoral degrees.\" That is a blatant lie. The owners of foreign, copycat sites steal our ideas and claim to provide quality services. Don\'t be fooled by their deception and completely bogus credentials. Anyone can create a \"pretty\" Web site and fill it with lies, empty promises, fake awards, and deceptive advertising techniques. You should be suspicious and hesitate to do business with sites that include or claim ANY of the following:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>AVOID any site that contains only a FAX number, especially the ones beginning with \"775\".</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">(775-242-6880, 775-599-4716, etc.; notoriously fraudulent Pakistani website own dozens of different sites and dozens of different FAX numbers that begin with the digits \"775.\". Moreover, it is easy to open a fax account with eFax.com. Anyone in the world can have a fax number for as low as $20.00 per month.)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Suspiciously low prices</strong><br />(Obvious sign of a foreign company! No professional writer will work for a dollar per page, please see the explanation why in the above part.)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Poor-quality design with a lack of content, no live support or phone numbers.</strong><br />(These websites are operated by teenagers without any idea of business or even creative thinking. Obviously, these kids do not spend a penny on professional programming and web-design. There is no way they will guarantee their business operable next month, thus no one will guarantee you a refund if your paper fails or proven plagiarized.)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>How to recover losses: </strong>If you have been a victim of such a website, received a plagiarized document, or missed your deadline and failed class, here is what you need to do. First of all, you need to call your bank and file a chargeback. Funds will be easily refunded, you just need to explain that the seller failed to deliver goods as promised. The materials you ordered were stolen. That will easily convince your bank to file charges against a&nbsp;dishonest seller. In this case, the website owner will be notified of chargeback. Chargebacks are painful to sellers, their merchant account can be closed because of multiple cases of chargeback, and it is easier for the seller to send you a full refund. Of course, none will refund you your failed class or admission, so getting your money back is the least you can do. If you sent your payment over the Western Union, you need to contact Western Union\\\'s Anti-Fraud Department.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The information above is provided as a courtesy of <strong>Student Network Resources</strong>.</p>','OZessay - a Company That Meets Customers\' Needs, Not Its Own','','publish','closed','closed','','warning','','','2017-05-17 10:31:25','2017-05-17 07:31:25','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(26,1,'2010-07-12 13:40:04','2010-07-12 10:40:04','','hire-only-professional-writers','','inherit','closed','closed','','hire-only-professional-writers','','','2017-05-17 10:31:25','2017-05-17 07:31:25','',25,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/images/article/og/hire-only-professional-writers.jpg?v=1494675253',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(27,1,'2014-01-31 09:00:11','2014-01-31 07:00:11','<p>The page you requested does not exist.

Like a lot of books, it is inspired by the author\'s personal experiences, but not so much so that it becomes a semi-biographical narrative rather than something that manages to stand up on its own. Since it is a bildungsroman, it should come as no surprise to learn that \'To Kill a Mockingbird\' focuses on the loss of innocence, with particular emphasis on racial issues that were prevalent in those times but remain relevant in the present.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"margin: 10px auto; display: block;\" title=\"To Kill a Mockingbird Book Cover\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/to-kill-a-mockingbird-book-cover.jpg\" alt=\"To Kill a Mockingbird Book Cover\" width=\"650\" height=\"470\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In brief, Scout is a six-year-old girl growing up in a Southern town during the Great Depression with her father Atticus Finch. Much of the novel focuses on the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man who is put on trial for the supposed rape of a white woman. Although Scout manages to prevent him from being lynched while Atticus manages to show that he was innocent, Tom is nonetheless convicted of the crime and then shot while attempting to escape. Afterward, Bob Ewell, the man who had accused Tom of rape, attempts to kill Scout and her brother as revenge against Atticus for unraveling his lies on the witness stand but is foiled by the town recluse, Boo Radley.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Who Are the Main Characters in \'To Kill a Mockingbird\'?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are a number of important characters in \'To Kill a Mockingbird\', but the most important is Scout, whose real name is Jean Louise Finch. After all, the narrative is based on her narrative. Furthermore, she is the one who is living through a coming-of-age story, albeit she is far from being the sole character to change as the narrative unfolds.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Scout\'s father, Atticus, is the character who is brought up most often. In part, this is because of his enormous role in the narrative since he is the one who volunteers to serve as Tom\'s defense attorney based on nothing more than his personal sense of right and wrong. However, it is interesting to note that Atticus is so respected that he becomes more a symbol than a man both inside the narrative and outside the narrative, though he remains human enough that he can still be shaken by what happens in the novel.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Next, there is Boo, whose reclusive nature makes him a focus for both the fear and the interest of the town\'s children. However, the conclusion of the narrative makes it clear that while Boo is a little strange from the perspective of most characters, he is not a bad man and his motivations are not incomprehensible. As a result, this makes him one of the most important characters in the novel because he is so central to one of its most important themes.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Finally, there is Tom, whose trial is the engine that provides the rest of the narrative with its momentum. His treatment as well as how other characters react to his treatment are integral to the setting, which in turn, makes it integral to the narrative.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">What Are the Main Ideas of \'To Kill a Mockingbird\'?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Courage is one of the main ideas of \'To Kill a Mockingbird\', though it takes more than one form. For example, Scout is willing to defend her father by fighting her bullies. In contrast, Atticus is willing to take on a case that will pit him against all of the racial prejudice that dominates the town, which will not hesitate to lash out at him as well should he get in its way. This willingness to stand up for what is right is what has made Atticus a hero for generation after generation, which is all the more impressive because it is tied to his compassion for others.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The loss of innocence is another main idea of \'To Kill a Mockingbird\'. In fact, it is actually tied to the name of the novel, since \'it\'s a sin to kill a mockingbird\' because mockingbird is nothing but helpful and harmless. However, Scout learns that in spite of this statement, neither the legal system nor the rest of the world is perfect, meaning that people can and do kill \'mockingbirds\', with Tom being the prime example.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Moving on, the novel makes the point that it is dangerous to make judgments without having evidence. After all, while Boo seems scary to the town children, his reclusive nature makes him harmless. As Scout realizes that he is not a bad person, she realizes that it is premature to judge other people based on their initial appearances.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Finally, since this is a bildungsroman, the narrative also touches on issues such as race, class, as well as both written and unwritten laws. In a real sense, this is Scout becoming more and more aware of all the currents that exist within a society, which is a natural part of growing up.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is difficult to comment on \'To Kill a Mockingbird\' without also commenting on \'Go Set a Watchman\', which is something between a first draft and a sequel to the novel. However, the two novels combined create a rather interesting them. In the first, protagonist becomes aware of the currents that move societies, while centering upon her father as her beacon of guidance. In the second, the protagonist becomes aware that even her father is not as perfect as she had imagined, but instead of rejecting him because of it, she chooses to accept him as being a mix of good and bad without ever succumbing to his beliefs at the same time.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;If you need any assistance with your essay writing you can contact our friendly support team and we will gladly help you or you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">place on order</a>&nbsp;and our professionals will write a great paper for you.</p>','Reflective Essay Example on the Novel \'To Kill a Mockingbird\'','','publish','closed','closed','','reflective-essay-free-example','','','2017-12-14 13:26:26','2017-12-14 11:26:26','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(30,1,'2016-08-15 12:00:32','2016-08-15 09:00:32','','reflective-essay-example3-v2','','inherit','closed','closed','','reflective-essay-example3-v2','','','2017-12-14 13:26:26','2017-12-14 11:26:26','',29,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/reflective-essay-example3-v2.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(31,1,'2016-08-12 12:12:36','2016-08-12 09:12:36','<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The standard essay will typically consist of five paragraphs. Typically introduced in high school, students sometimes have a difficult time differentiating between a high school essay and the type of essay and prose that is required in a college-level composition. Most essays are logically organized with the introduction, body, and conclusion that flow seamlessly together to organize thoughts that will end with a well-supported thesis.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The introduction of the college essay typically includes a thesis statement, with the writer introducing the main theme or argument that they will pursue in the body of the paragraph. This paragraph will normally include three points as examples. The three consecutive body paragraphs would then follow this introductory paragraph, with each individual paragraph expanding upon the three points that were introduced in the initial paragraph.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The fifth paragraph of the college essay will be the concluding paragraph, and it will briefly restate the thesis and touch upon any examples that were expanded upon in the body of the paragraph. Many students also take this opportunity to make a statement about the thesis. Depending on the subject, it is also acceptable to finish the concluding paragraph with a question to provoke further thought.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">What Are the Educational Purposes of the College Essay?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The essay will typically consist of five paragraphs - a classic format for compositions. It is a useful model to persuade and educate. It is a viable way to develop analytical skills, as it is a format that is very useful and relatable to different areas of study.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">How Is the College Essay Different Than the High School Essay?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The original five paragraph essay is introduced in high school, with some students even being acquainted with it in grade school. The format is straightforward, with five paragraphs that will support a particular idea. However, college essays are a bit more complicated than that. It is required that college students include a strong thesis statement.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Also, most college essays require proper citations and references to back up any claims made in the college essay. This includes a citation page that properly attribute sources. If quotes are going to be used in the college essay to further flesh out a point, then they need to be properly indented and formatted.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many high school students also insert \"in conclusion\" in the ending paragraph. This is not acceptable in a college-level essay since it will be obvious that the ending paragraph will be the concluding paragraph that will reinforce the thesis statement.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Different Formats of the College Essay</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">At the college Level, there are typically two types of essay formats. This Includes the Modern Language Association - or the MLA format, and the American Psychological Association Style, or the APA style of writing. The MLA format is most commonly used in college, with it being used mostly by those in the liberal arts. The APA style, however, tends to be the preferred method of writing for students in the sciences.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The MLA style requires students to be cognizant about page numbers, spacings and indentations, and the citation of references within the essay. It is simpler than the APA format. For the APA style of writing, students are required to carefully cite their work, utilizing different methods to do so within an essay. It also requires students to include a title page and an abstract at the very beginning of their essay.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">What Makes a Compelling College Essay?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One of the areas that many college students lack is the careful proofreading of their written work. Most students are aware of the many methods of editing to make sure that it is aligned with the appropriate grammar and pronoun use, but proofreading requires running a fine-toothed comb through the college essay to ensure a compelling piece of literature.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">College essay writing service <a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au\">ozessay.com.au</a> is that objective pair of eyes that will pinpoint mistakes in your college essay. A 2008 survey showed that freshman write an average of 92 pages during the year, and seniors right an average of 148 pages. This is a lot of papers, thesis statements, editing, and proofreading. It is natural for many college students to feel fatigued. An outside, impartial review of a written piece can help pinpoint literary issues that might\'ve been overseen by college students.</p>','Write My College Essay: Using a Writing Service','','publish','closed','closed','','write-my-college-essay','','','2017-05-12 16:03:07','2017-05-12 13:03:07','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(32,1,'2016-08-12 12:12:36','2016-08-12 09:12:36','','write-my-college-essay4-v2','','inherit','closed','closed','','write-my-college-essay4-v2','','','2017-05-12 16:03:07','2017-05-12 13:03:07','',31,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/write-my-college-essay4-v2.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(33,1,'2016-08-10 18:20:09','2016-08-10 15:20:09','<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Are you usually up late, sweating it out when you get assigned to make a PowerPoint presentation? There\'s really nothing to it if you know what you\'re doing. PowerPoint gets a bad rap these days for being outdated and boring but with a little imagination a presentation can actually be a thing of beauty. A compelling and game-changing thing, even.&nbsp;Here are 10 ways to help you add a little zing! to all of your Power Points. They are not the most technical tips, just the ones that will stun your audience the most.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">1. Storyboard It</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Start by planning your PowerPoint presentation. Most of us are creating our presentations with no flow or logic. Have you ever thought that your presentation should have a beginning, middle and end, just like a <a title=\"A Story of College Life\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/a-story-of-college-life\">story</a> or essay? This gives the presentation <a title=\"Essay Structure\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-structure\">structure</a> and leads listeners on a journey, instead of a disjointed path where you are constantly tugging them back and forth from fact to graph.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">PowerPoint presentations are a visual medium, like films, and require some laying-out if each slide, like a movie scene, is going to make sense in context with the others. Most importantly, always leave your audience wanting the next slide.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">2. One Thing at a Time, Please</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Go one point at a time. Your audience is programmed to read the entirety of what is on screen. Slow them down by putting each point on a different slide, or by having each bullet point revealed individually on your cue. This tip puts you in control and lets you decide the pace.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. No Paragraphs</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Less text and more brilliant visuals make for a happy and entertained audience. Audiences only want to read the very distinctive takeaway points that they should be gleaning from your research. Keep your points at that and nothing more. Remember, your audience is reading, seeing images and listening to your voice the entire time. They may even be taking notes along the way. Don\'t overwhelm them with sources of information.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">4. Pay Attention to Design</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Cut out all the cheesy effects. Just because they\'re there to use doesn\'t mean that they don\'t look pathetically outdated.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Use a sans serif font for body text, like Arial, Helvetica, or Calibri.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Stop using decorative fonts like calligraphy, German blackface, futuristic, psychotic handwriting, flowers, art nouveau, etc. because they are hard to read and don\'t show up as well on projectors like Georgia or Baskerville do.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Put dark text on a light background because it\'s the easiest to read.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Align text left because it\'s a more natural way to read than centered text.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Avoid the clutter of anything beyond a headline, a few bullet points, maybe an image.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You may also like these articles:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/tips-for-using-the-control-panel\">Tips for Using the Control Panel</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-book-report/template\">Template for a Stellar Book Report</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/five-paragraph-essay\">Five-Paragraph Essay</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/free-sample-essay-about-sports\">Essay about Sports</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order-custom-term-paper\">Order Custom Term Paper</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">5. Use Images</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Use one big, high-resolution image per slide. One image is plenty to keep the attention of the audience, along with a couple of bullet points and the sound of your well-spoken words.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">6. Think Big Picture</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Be as brilliantly dressed and put together as your slides. Your audience should be looking at you more than any of the PowerPoint presentation. Make sure you are looking your best and standing and speaking with authority so your audience knows that you mean <a title=\"What Is a Business Essay?\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/business-essay\">business</a>.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">7. Use a Hook</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Do like the best <a title=\"A Manual for Writers of Term Papers\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/manual-writers-term-papers\">writers</a> do and add a juicy hook at the beginning to get your audience interested in the rest of the presentation. This can be done in several ways. One may be to pose a question or start a story that you intend to answer or explain at the end. Or you can end each slide with a slight bit of suspense that leads to the next slide.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">8. Throw in Some Good Questions</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Build questions throughout the presentation by asking your audience questions. It can be big, unanswerable life questions, or smaller poll-style queries that the entire room can answer by show of hands. Get them involved with the questions, whether they are turning that question around in their head for the duration of the presentation, or if it is being answered on the very next slide.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">9. Modulate Your Voice and Vary Your Tone</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Speak to your audience as if you were telling a story at the dinner table. Craft it for your specific audience and breath some life into your voice with inflection, projection and some well-chosen softer moments.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">10. Break the Rules</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Break the PowerPoint rules you grew up with, and even the ones we mention here. For instance, sure those clip art pics and effects are cheesy and outdated, there are the odd instances where those elements work well and add a splash of satire. Be creative with this medium because too many people have made some snoringly dull PowerPoint presentations over the years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">11. Bonus Tip: Call the Pros</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Never make a bored face during your PowerPoint presentations again.

Students look deep into the book and, through the book report, apply what they learned through the book to the world around them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">An outstanding book report considers the historical context of the book at the time in which it was written. It may even go in depth so far as to consider the state of mind at the time of writing. For example, it may answer such questions as<em> What was Sylvia Plath going through in her marriage when she wrote The Bell Jar, and how did it affect her style and content? What was Charles Bukowski going through mentally, and physically due to his drinking when he wrote Ham on Rye?</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Everyone wants to hand in outstanding work but the legwork to create one is intense, especially if you are doing them regularly or in multiple classes. If you want an outstanding book report, we recommend getting the help of an experienced book report writing service <a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au\">ozessay.com.au.</a></p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>Here\'s what the average professor will expect to see in an effective and compelling book report:</strong></em></h4>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Introductory Paragraph</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As the first paragraph of the essay, the introductory has a lot of tasks in catching the reader up to where you need them to be. It also has to make the subject interesting enough to them that they want to read more&mdash;on their own volition, not just because they have to administer a mark for the piece. Grabbing interest can be done in several ways, either by creating some mystery or suspense or by stressing the&nbsp;importance of the issues addressed by the novel.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Characters Paragraph</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A character paragraph gives a brief sketch of all of the characters, based on facts, habits, choices and actions from the story. A very keen character paragraph will even look at some of the hints that are dropped throughout the story and include those as well. You may look into the \"real\" motives behind a character\'s actions or choices, or make an educated guess at their background details that the author left undiscovered.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Plot Summary Paragraph</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The plot summary should actually come in several paragraphs, perhaps broken down into beginning, middle and end, although the content can fall in just about any order that serves your needs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The plot summary can be as detailed as you like, but it is recommended that you don\'t get bogged down in details that don\'t serve the purpose of proving your understanding of the story, its themes, and characters.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One trick that our writers often use is to first break the book down into acts and then fill in the three most important details of those acts. Then they fill in some minor (important) details about each of those acts and they use that as the skeleton for their plot summary breakdown. It is important to make stops along the way to touch on details throughout that might support your initial impressions or ideas about the book.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The conclusion is a way to neatly wrap up your final thoughts about the book. If there is something that this book has inspired in you&mdash;a new love for Shakespeare, or a new philosophy on life&mdash;then this is a great place to put it. Likewise, if the story you read or the characters you encountered opened your mind in a way that makes you want to spring into action for a cause.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Novels are here to be reflections of life and reality, even the ones that are the most surreal, so it\'s important to be active readers and take on what we have read in a way that it will help shape our lives. If you can show how you will carry on the lessons of this book throughout the rest of your life, you have a stellar book report on your hands.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why is a book report writing service a brilliant idea?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A knowledgeable book report service <a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au\">ozessay.com.au</a> will get you through the areas that you get most bogged down with when it comes to writing book reports.

They\'re used to help conduct research, formulate an accurate and confident hypothesis about a particular scientific event or function, review information that is associated with the hypothesis, allow a third party to replicate the study, and scientifically explore a theoretical explanation.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many high school students are exposed to lab reports, as they are usually required for many science classes. The same goes for college and graduate level courses, with scientific explanations and events being more meticulous. The primary job of a lab report is to establish the purpose for doing the experiment that you are reporting on.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-lab-report\">HOW TO WRITE A LAB REPORT</a></strong></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A lab report is more than just getting a good grade in a science class. It is an opportunity to understand what is going on in the experiment by fleshing out scientific concepts. Lab reports can be particularly beneficial for students, as they will be required to convey behaviors and events onto paper. Transferring observed events to a lab report can help to solidify scientific thought.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/lab-report-format.jpg\" alt=\"Lab Report Format\" width=\"650\" height=\"340\" /></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Understanding the Lab Report Format</h3>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n<li>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>The statement of the problem.</strong></em> In this part of the lab report, students include preliminary observations or background information to help explain \'what questions am I trying to answer?\'</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<p><em><strong>The scientific hypothesis.</strong></em> In a hypothesis, students are to flesh out the solution to the particular problem, ensuring that possible solutions are in complete sentences. For any statements made, it is important that they are capable of being proven with a scientific method.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<p><em><strong>The materials used.</strong></em> It is imperative that all materials used during the scientific experiment are recorded. All peripheral devices also need to be recorded.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<p><em><strong>The procedures.</strong></em> In this section, students and scientists write a couple of sentences explaining what they did in the lab. Typically, detailed step-by-step instructions will also be included in this section. The procedure needs to be thorough in its instruction, allowing anyone who reads this section the ability to repeat the experiment.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<p><em><strong>Results and data.</strong></em> This section will encompass any data tables, diagrams, observations, and notes that were taken during the lab. This is to substantiate observations.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<p><em><strong>The conclusion of the lab report.</strong></em> In this section, the hypothesis is either accepted or rejected, with an explanation derived from the procedure and results. At this point, most students will include a summary to help the reader understand results. This may include mathematics, averages, and other information that can help quantify data. Students would then be asked to include a couple of sentences of the things that they\'ve learned during the experiment. Possible errors should also be fleshed out and explained. Note that even if your findings do not support your initial hypothesis, they\'re still valuable. Even when the hypothesis is incorrect, students are still able to hone in on imagining scientific concepts and move further deeper into understanding the sciences and research without going down the same path. Many students tend to become frustrated with an inaccurate hypothesis, thinking that they are completely wrong if their hypothesis is incorrect.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>Grammar and lab report.</strong></em> Countless students tend to overlook the importance of syntax and grammar when it comes to lab reports. It is important that a clear voice and grammatical style are used. For example, traditional lab reports are usually written in passive voice and use the third person narrative. For example, instead of writing \'I conducted the study with my partner\', you use instead \'this study was conducted by John Doe and Jane Doe, and it was hypothesized that &ndash;\'. Depending on the science teacher and the details in the assignment, the passive voice tends to be the preferred method.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">What Makes for Writing a Good Lab Report?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Don\'t be afraid to use a first and final draft when it comes to lab reports, as long as the initial information is transferred over. Many students find flowcharts to be particularly beneficial, as they allow to help imagine procedures and information about the experiment. A clear, concise title can be the component that separates a lab report that\'s lacking, and a lab report that is compelling right from the beginning.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why Is It Better to Find a Writing Service to Write a Lab Report?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As mentioned, grammar is critical when it comes to creating a compelling lab report. OZessay.com.au will not only create a comprehensive, thorough lab paper, but it will ensure that it will use your appropriate voice and pronouns.

The process is also referred to as the capital punishment where the judicial verdict that a person should be put to death, while the real enforcement is called the execution. Crimes lead to the application of death penalty are identified as capital offenses or a capital crime. This paper will discuss death penalty facts, its merits, and demerits, the paper will highlight some wrongful penalty cases and the death penalty in different countries. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Death Penalty States</strong></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The capital sentence is legal in 32 US states after it was re-established by the supreme court in 1976, &nbsp;as December 2014, about 1394 people have been executed. &nbsp;At least 1 in 25 people who receive death verdicts in the US is innocent. States spend more in carrying out trials that involve capital punishment since they are more costly than trials that are seeking life in prison sentence. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The carrying of the death penalty is considered as a way through which the government honors human dignity by offering retribution to the victims; that provides the consolation of the grieving families. Affected families will feel at ease knowing that such perpetrators of heinous crimes never can cause future tragedies to other families. People fear nothing else other than death; the death sentence is viewed as a perfect way through which the government can deter criminals from committing capital offenses and protecting citizens from such criminal offenses. The government spends a lot of money on feedings, clothing and the provision of health care to the capital offenders. Criminal have been reported to escape maximum security prisons such murderers go back and kill again causing great agony to affected families. Such adverse incidents would have been eliminated if such person were executed after they were found guilty of murder.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">However, critics argue that death is severe punishment, no government or state should be given the right to take human life. Capital punishment is rather taken as a mere act of revenge, which is considered as a rational response to a critical situation. In the year 2000, 87 convicted people on death row were freed after crimes placed on them were removed due to their innocence. &nbsp;In every judgment made on death row, there is always the existence of a margin of error where for every 7 persons executed one is innocent. The physicians who administer the executions infringe their pledge to defend and protect human lives which erode the public assurance that should be placed on the medical profession. It is believed that death punishment is only meant for the poor since the rich can afford a good defense.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Executions of Innocent People</strong></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The Claude Jones case who was executed in the year 2000 for the murder of Allen Hilzendager sentenced to death and later proved to have executed an innocent person since the hair belonged to the victim. The Larry Griffin case who was executed in 1995 a crime of drive-by shooting that allegedly killed a 19 years old drug dealer named Quintin Moss from St. Louis. The act of never contacting the witness defense or prosecution, later investigations proved that the case identified that Missouri executed an innocent man. The minorities are subjected to capital punishment where in every 3 persons executed in the US, 2 of them are African American. As at 2007 48% of the defendant in federal cases with the death penalty is African American when they are only 13% of the nation&rsquo;s population.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Currently, about 58 nations in the world actively practice capital punishment; among them, 98 countries have also abolished it for all crimes where they have replaced it with life imprisonment. Other seven nations have also abolished capital punishment for ordinary crimes, leaving it to extraordinary situations such as crime against humanity and war crimes. About 35 countries have eradicated the punishment de-facto where they have not carried it out for a period of ten years. 140 countries are considered by the amnesty international to have ended the act of executing the death sentence. The international law prohibits all countries in the world from carrying out capital punishment on persons who are under the age of 18 years at the time they committed their crimes. However, some countries have been involved in juvenile capital crimes such Sudan Iran and Saudi Arabia. Over 60 percent of people in the world lives in nations where capital punishment take places such as Indonesia, United States of America, India, and China as the four most populous countries in the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">If you liked this critical essay example and want our writers to write the similar one for you, place an order on our <a title=\"Order Page\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">Order Page</a>.

Individual scientists are responsible for performing experiments to test their hypotheses about different scientific phenomena.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once all of the experiments are done, the researchers have the job of trying to persuade other individuals to either reject or accept their hypothesis by providing them with an interpretation of their data and findings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The lab report is the main tool used to try and persuade others to join their side. If the results are able to withstand the harsh criticism of the public, they will end up becoming a widely accepted body of knowledge until someone is able to disprove them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Because these reports are so labor-intensive, many people find themselves struggling to be able to get the reports done in time. That\'s when many end up turning to someone else for lab report help to get the job done on time.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">How to Write a Lab Report</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The first thing you need to do to get started on your lab report is to come to some sort of agreement about what type of information is going to be included in the report. Oftentimes, lab reports contain a title, abstract, introduction, materials, and methods, results, discussion and literature cited sections. Once you have developed the lab reports outline, you need to begin filling in each section of the report with vital information. To make sure you have ample material to compile your report, follow the steps below:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 1.</strong> Read through your lab manual to make sure you have a thorough understanding of what you need to do before beginning the experiment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 2.</strong> Consult with your supervisor as you go through the lab experiment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 3.</strong> Plan out the steps carefully with your lab partners. You don\'t want to rush around trying to get everything done in a short amount of time. You could end up with inaccurate data in the process.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 4.</strong> Record all of your findings carefully to make sure you have them right.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 5.</strong> Consult with your lab partners about everything that you are doing on your part of the project.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 6.</strong> Think about your target audience. Take it beyond just your lab instructor.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Choosing the Topic</strong></h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When it comes to choosing a topic for your lab report, you want to make sure that you are choosing a topic that you can relate to. There should be a strong hypothesis with supporting evidence. If you cannot support your hypothesis, the whole foundation of the report is lost. You need to be able to conduct experiments that are going to substantiate your claim and lay the foundation for what you have to say.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Outline the relationship between the two subjects you are studying very clearly and then come up with supporting information to back up your claims. Don\'t choose a topic that is so obscure you wouldn\'t be able to come up with enough research on the subject.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Doing the Research</strong></h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The research is often the most enjoyable part of the lab report. You should spend time conducting any number of experiments to prove or disprove your hypothesis. Make sure you take accurate notes so you can create a detailed chart later on with all of the data in it.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Making an Outline</strong></h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before making your first draft, you need to spend time outlining your report. List all of the different sections that are going to be included in the report and come up with a few bullet points for each section. This gives you a foundation on which to build your report and helps you create a smooth and logical lab report structure.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-lab-report/format\">LAB REPORT FORMAT</a></strong></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Drafting</strong></h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Next, spend time creating your first draft. Add all of the relevant information to each section of your paper. Make sure you fill in each section with the necessary details and supporting tables and charts. You want your first draft to be as packed with information as possible. The last thing you want to do is leave out a pivotal part of the information that could throw your whole lab report off.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Editing and Proofreading</strong></h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now that you have your first draft completed, you need to spend time going back through it and editing it for any grammatical or spelling issues. Make sure your paragraphs flow from one to the next. Your information should be clear and concise. Avoid using a bunch of fluff or filler. Edit out anything that doesn\'t belong or doesn\'t add value to the piece.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The conclusion of your lab report should summarize your findings. It should tie together your hypothesis and supporting experimental findings. Readers should be left with a solid understanding of why your hypothesis is accurate and how you got there.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why You Should Hire a Professional Writing Service</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Since lab reports take a lot of time, many people find themselves looking for a lab report online.

In its most basic form, a research paper is based on a claim made by the writer, free of anecdotal bias. Research paper, as the name suggests, relies heavily on researching the materials by others to back up a claim.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Most of the research can be lifted by reading books, using references, or even performing experiments. Typically, high school students will be required to write a research paper at some point in their educational lives. However, some of these reports tend to be very superficial, absent of the heavy research that is typically required for investigative papers in a college-level class.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Structure of a Research Paper</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Like most written bodies of work, a research paper consists of a strong title that is indicative of the research or project that it will address.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The introduction</strong> of the research paper will consist of points that aggregate the topic, providing basic background information to introduce readers to the particular subject that it will expand upon. Towards the end of the introduction, the intro will narrow down to specific research questions or scenarios.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The bulk</strong> of the research paper will be the synthesis of gathered analysis, with a careful review of major theories linked to the specific issue or topic. The body of the research paper will consist of relevant resources in the form of quotes and references from academic journals or peer-reviewed articles.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The conclusion</strong> of the research paper discusses results and any implications. A hypothesis that was introduced in the article, should be answered in the body of the research paper, with the concluding paragraph leaving the reader satisfied and feel like they can confidently support your claims.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Difficulties Faced by Students When Writing a Research Paper</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As mentioned, a student\'s first introduction to research papers is in high school, where they are assigned surface level research assignments. This leaves many students lacking the required skills of creating a compelling, persuasive research paper. These are some of the critical points where students tend to falter.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Lack of proper citations.</em> Broadly speaking, citations refer to the references used to make points throughout a research paper. Citations are required to ensure intellectual honesty, to help avoid plagiarism, as well as to properly attribute work to the correct sources. It gives research papers credibility, plausibility, and an authoritative slant. However, many students do not know how to properly cite their work, with some students even forgoing the citation process altogether.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Using the improper citation format.</em> The American psychological Association style manual is typically used for research papers that are associated with the social sciences. However, students will need to use a proper citation formatting for their particular discipline, topic, or theme. Students have a wider range of citation styles and formats, these include the Modern Language Association and the Turabian and Chicago style. In most academic scenarios, the MLA format is largely preferred.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Many students simply feel intimidated by the resear</em><em>ch papers.</em> Students who have not taken writing intensive classes in their formative years may find writing research papers intimidating and unfamiliar. Some students may not receive criticism at all and only a letter grade. This only reinforces poor prose, as their weaknesses have not been properly identified by counselors and teachers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Introducing additional claims in concluding paragraph.</em> The introduction and body of the research paper will answer all claims - there should not be more claims made in the concluding paragraph. Students, not knowing the proper format of a research paper, manage to introduce more data in the ending paragraph.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Getting The Help For the Best Research Paper</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Students can use different approaches when it comes to writing a research paper. Some papers use extensive research to justify a specific claim or argument, or even use poem and other forms of literature. Unfortunately, many students think that they could just read up on research, and regurgitated findings on their word processor. This will only lead to a lackadaisical report, with claims that are backed by poor resources that could easily be refuted.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, many students still have many options to create a comprehensive, compelling research paper.

Brexit is an abbreviation of \"British exit,\" and refers to the UK\'s plan to depart the European Union. The official referendum was held throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on June 23, 2016, and the decision by popular vote was to leave. Those that support the measure to leave are called \'Brexiters\' and they came out on top in all four UK countries.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li><em>England voted Leave: 53.4% to 46.6%&nbsp;</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Wales voted Leave: 52.5% to 47.5%</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Scotland voted Remain: 62% to 38%</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Northern Ireland voted Remain: 55.8% to 44.2%&nbsp;</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Reasons for Brexit</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The greatest risk of Brexit is that no another country has ever departed from the union before. The pros and cons of any country leaving &mdash; or four countries at once &mdash; are merely projections. Only time can tell whether the countries will actually do what Brexit campaigners told them it would.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Brexit campaigners told their constituents that the UK will no longer be responsible for paying into the budget of the European Union. That\'s true, but they probably won\'t be saving as much as they were told. In 2015, the UK would have been liable for &pound;18 billion in contributions but thanks to a rebate program set up by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher they also received an instant &pound;5 billion rebate. Add to that the &pound;4.5 billion that the EU spent in the UK in 2015 and that brings the net contribution down to about &pound;8.5 billion.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Despite cries from their fellow countrymen and several world leaders, Brexiters make up a worrying percentage of the population who subscribe to the growing trend of nationalism around the globe. The vote to leave the EU signifies a growing distrust in worldwide trade and commerce organizations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/10-persuasive-essay-topics-ethical-dilemmas\">10 Persuasive Writing Topics: Ethical Dilemmas</a></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-on-change\">Essay on Change</a></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/problem-solving\">What Is Problem Solving?</a></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/panama-papers\">Panama Papers</a></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-on-writing\">Essay on Writing</a>&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">With more sovereignty comes more dominion over trade agreements for the UK but it also means a loss of leverage when it comes to negotiating their own deals in the future. Optimists see it as an opportunity for the UK to reinvent itself as a Singapore-style super economy, while detractors feel that Britain has now lost the ability to leverage its place in the EU to create better deals. 443 UK will remain a member of both NATO and the UN, but even there Remain voters worry that their influence will now be weak.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Yet another trigger that put Brexit on the ballot was the immigration crises that swept across Europe in the last couple years. While those that support the EU say that it\'s a moral obligation of the wealthier countries to aid immigrants with placements and jobs, all Brexiters saw was an influx of immigrants that seemed to never end. After an annual increase of about 285,000 people per year (raising the population by about 0.4% every year), in 2015 that number reached 333,000 immigrants (184,000 of whom were from the EU). Despite the nationalistic, and possibly racist-seeming undertones of a vote against immigration, Brexiters say that they worry about the impact of job-seekers moving around Europe, changing the economic landscape. It\'s the kind of nationalistic attitude does not reflect that of the globally-minded EU and probably a good reason why no another country is willing to be labeled racist and elitist in exchange for sovereignty.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Leaders of Brexit</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One of Theresa May\'s initial moves after David Cameron\'s departure was to appointment foreign secretary and leader of the official Leave campaign, Boris Johnson, to her official department responsible for carrying out the will of the people. Joining him there are veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, and international trade secretary, Liam Fox. The three men were colloquially dubbed the Three Brexiters by the media and made to look like the Three Stooges by left-aligned media.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Main Facts on the Brexit Process</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Britain could break from the UK by 2019, but being the first time in history that Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty&mdash;the necessary catalyst to Brexit&mdash;will be invoked, and given the complexity the deals being unraveled, an extension wouldn\'t be surprising. At a glance, this is what an un-interrupted Brexit process could look like.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/steps-to-UK-leaving-yhe-European-Union.png\" alt=\"Steps to UK Leaving European Union\" width=\"650\" height=\"1231\" /><br />Source - www.bbc.co.uk</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Results of Brexit</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some see this referendum as a wake-up call that rising inequality and low growth can and will promote frustration among citizens who yearn not only for a voice but also \"something different\". The Brexit ballot, offering only a \"Leave\" or \"Remain\" options was won by 52% to 48%. Although one side won over the other, the referendum was not won by a significant majority, and certainly not unanimous.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Immediately following the referendum, the pound fell to its lowest value in decades. But most of the UK was ready for some backlash from a market that hates sudden change. But the greatest surprise was how quickly former Prime Minister, David Cameron, stepped down from his post follow the loss of the Brexit referendum. That left, Theresa May, former home secretary, as the new Prime Minister. May has stated officially that she intends to carry out the will of the people and continue with the pre-Brexit procedures.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Meaning of Brexit for the World and the UK</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">While leaving the EU will allow Britain to re-establish itself as a truly independent nation, Britons will eventually have to limit the amount of work, travel or leisure that they currently enjoy within EU borders. Some Remain voters liken it to turning back the clock to pre-WWII when European countries did all of their waring and tradings independently. What Brexit means immediately is a lot of waiting and watching for countries that trade with the UK and investors who have money there.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One thing to note is that Britain\'s economy is strong enough that no one needs to expect a sudden collapse or burst bubble. As the EU amputates one of it\'s strongest limbs &mdash; so strong they never did take on the Euro as their local currency &mdash; care and time will be taken not make the ordeal more painful than it has to be.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why Is Brexit Such a Big Deal?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Besides setting a precedent for being the first member to officially leave the European Union, the reason why Brexit is such a big deal is that we just don\'t know how it will turn out yet. It\'s a big, dramatic move that will take years to complete; years of shifts that will impact the pound and European markets along the way. It will certainly make the UK countries seem less hospitable to new immigrants but whether Brexit will deter terrorism, buoy the economy and make the UK stronger through independence has yet to be seen. So maybe the big deal is just not knowing the extent of the impact on jobs, homes, trade relationships with other countries and whether countries outside of the union will see a fragmented Europe as a weakened one. One that, say, might give up some power over the Balkan states to Russia.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sometimes, you feel like Britain searching for its \"exit\".

In order to come up with an excellent research paper, you must pay extra attention to every detail. A systematic approach to the designing of the paper to the final copy will help you ensure that you do not leave out any important points. Here are a few tips that will help you come up with a perfect research paper.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Step 1: Let&rsquo;s the party begin</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Like any other project, you must start your research writing the project with a well laid down plan. In this case, consider what particular area of study and subject matter you want to research. From this broad angle, you then have to streamline your ideas and come up with a more defined narrow scope that will be the focus of your research paper. It is advisable to write down all the ideas you have about that particular subject area as they flood into your mind at this stage.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Step 2: Your choice matters</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The key moment to consider in your research writing project is the choosing of your research topic. Our research paper writing service OZessay.com.au will provide you with detailed tips on how to come up with a good topic. Once the scope is clear, it should be easy to select a relevant topic. Your topic has to have several features including:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The research paper topic has to be clear so that the reader can easily understand what your research paper is all about after the first read.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The research paper topic must be concise. Avoid being too wordy as you are more likely to confuse the reader with many words. Try to say all you need to say as few words as possible and at the same time give a clear picture.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The research paper topic must be catchy. A good topic grasps the reader\'s attention and provokes them to read further.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The research paper must have the keywords concerning the concept of discussion. Choose the wording of the topic carefully to ensure that the keywords and the primary concepts of the study are apparent.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Step 3: Turning Sherlock mode on</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When you are clear about what you want to discuss in your research paper, it is time to carry out some research. Prior preparation helps you to save time so that when you get to carrying out your research you are more strategic. You should use different to assist you in conducting quality research for your paper including; the internet, library, and other forms of mass media. Depending on your kind of research, you may also have to carry out interviews with individuals or groups to provide you the relevant data to include in your research paper.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">From these sources, you will be able to access academic papers, periodicals and other literature that will greatly inform your research paper writing project. From the internet, you can also order research paper at OZessay.com.au, which has been custom made for you after you submit your topic of interest and specifications. You may also buy research paper in similar subject areas to provide with information that will help you develop your research paper.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Step 4: Outlining the main ideas</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Upon completion of your research process, and you have adequate knowledge, you need to organize this information. You will have to go through all the concepts discussed from the various resources you have come across and sieve out the information to get what is relevant to your particular paper. Although everything may seem important, you must understand that your research paper must be of a reasonable length and so you will have to leave out some things.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The best way to do this is to come up with an outline. Choose the most important things that will form the basis of your discussion. Also, at this stage determine what will be discussed first to the last.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Step 5: Drafting, drafting, drafting</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">From the outline, draft the research paper. Drafting involves coming up with the various sections of the research paper. Depending on the specification given by your professors, formulate a skeleton of the research paper. Decide what sub-topics and subsections you will include in your paper. Finally, add the meat to each of the sections. Thus, add all the information you had researched into the right segments.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Step 6: REP: revise, edit, proofread</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Editing and proofreading your research paper involves: ensuring that there is coherency of ideas, spell checking, ensuring that the right academic writing style has been applied to the latter among many other things. Edit your work to ensure the paper rightly communicates what you intended. Our research paper writing service OZessay.com.au will provide you with this service.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Step 7: At last, but not at least</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Most students fail to include a conclusion in their research paper. You must always include a conclusion in your research paper. A conclusion gives an overview of the concepts discussed. In the conclusion, you can give your personal recommendations that you think are relevant from your study. You may also propose further studies that should be done in that particular subject area.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why it is better to hire a professional writing service</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A professional research paper writing service OZessay.com.au assures you of getting a high-quality research paper.

Wherever you go you are sure to find someone using the Internet to do something. At work, school or home, you cannot escape the Internet, and for good reason. The Internet allows you to connect with people in a way, unlike anything you could ever imagine. It doesn\'t matter where someone is located in the world because there is always a way to get ahold of them online. Because of this, social networking has taken the Internet by storm. Wondering whether social networking is worth it? Find out more about whether social networking is a bane or a boon here.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Social Networking: What Is It Exactly?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many people use social networking sites to be able to connect with people who share the same type of interests they do. These dedicated applications and websites were created to give people like you the chance to connect with other users around the globe. Just because you can\'t find someone nearby who shares the same interests as you do that doesn\'t mean there aren\'t plenty of other people out there who do. Social networking is the key to being able to connect with people from around the world who all share the same common interests.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto;\" title=\"Social Networking: a Boon or a Bane for the Society?\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/social-networking-essay-sample.jpg\" alt=\"People, connecting each other via social networking\" width=\"650\" height=\"642\" /></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Benefits of Social Networking</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Social networking provides you with a means of connecting with students who are going to college elsewhere and see what they are learning. In fact, you could end up helping each other study for upcoming midterms and learn something new from one another. You never know what one school is teaching over another, but networking gives you the opportunity to learn and grow more.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One of the biggest benefits to social networking is the fact that you can make new friends and communicate with old friends and family members. Even though you might have lost touch before, you can quickly get back in touch with those that you miss the most. You will also meet a whole new group of people and have the opportunity to form new friendships that could end up lasting a lifetime&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Social networking also gives you the chance to put yourself out there in a positive light. You have the chance to let others know exactly what you have to offer, which can help you out if you are looking for a job and trying to build your network of connections. You can tell people what your skills are and let them know what it is that you are looking to do in life. You never know who someone else might know, which is why it pays to put yourself out there in a positive light and make sure everyone gets the chance to know the real you.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Drawbacks of Social Networking</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">By partaking in social networking sites, you are opening yourself up to cyberbullying. Even though there might be a number of good people out there, there are also a lot of bad people as well. While you might be trying to connect with people who share the same interests, someone else might be out there to tear you down and make you feel like less of an individual. Cyberbullying is huge and isn\'t something that anyone should have to deal with, but it happens all the time.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Social networks can also cause people to feel bad about themselves. You might see someone who is younger than you with more things than what you have, thus causing you to feel insecure about who you are and what you have accomplished in life. Even though you might not know that person\'s history, that doesn\'t make it any less traumatizing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There is also the chance that someone could go online and post an inappropriate picture of you that is taken out of context. What might seem innocent enough soon becomes the main focus of everyone\'s jokes and harassment toward you. You cannot control what other people post online. Even though you can fight it, you end up spending a lot of your time stressing out over what is going to appear online next. That\'s when you have to ask yourself if it is really worth it in the end.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">While no one can say for sure whether social networking is a boon or a bane, it will continue to be a pivotal part of society. Even though one person might benefit from it greatly, another person could end up being hurt by it.

There are two compare and contrast essay format types.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The first compare and contrast essay type:</strong></h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Introduction.&nbsp;</strong>It includes general phrases and quotations that will incrementally lead to the main idea of the writing a definite compare and contrast essay.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>First topic.&nbsp;</strong>This part examines the entire scope of the first topic features, it&rsquo;s characteristics, facts, and figures. You do not need to cover the second subject here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Second topic.&nbsp;</strong>Write a detailed discussion about the second topic, analyzing its advantages and disadvantages, and making the general evaluation.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Both topics together.&nbsp;</strong>Here you need to give a breakdown on the both topics, comparing and contrasting each other. You can expand the discussion to the several paragraphs, depending on how much comparison and contrast you want to make.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Conclusion.&nbsp;</strong>This part of the essay should simplify the thesis statement, show the results of the entire compare and contrast research and your proficiency in the researched topic. In addition, you need to restate your introduction thesis statement as proving that you managed to convince the readers in the main essay claim.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The second compare and contrast essay format type:</strong></h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Introduction.&nbsp;</strong>Just like the first format option, the introduction for your compare and contrast essay should hold within it a quotation, an anecdote, and a generalization; all of these things should lead into your thesis statement that you take on for the essay.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Compare both topic one and topic two.&nbsp;</strong>In this format, you need to make sure this section is made up of several paragraphs. You need to go through every similarity that you have to show for each of the topics that you are presenting within your essay. You should give three comparisons&hellip; within each of the comparisons should give an example from each topic that you have, making sure you have comparisons for each one.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Contrast both topic one and topic two. </strong>Just like the comparisons section, the contrast section should be made up of several paragraphs. Within these paragraphs, you need to go through the differences of the two topics that you have for your essay. With this as well, you need to show three contrasts and give examples for each topic that you are covering in your essay.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Conclusion.&nbsp;</strong>Just as in the other format, the conclusion of this essay format is bringing a close to everything that you have provided within your essay. Restate your thesis statement here, again making sure you reword it&hellip; you want to come across as being confident in the conclusion. You should show here that you have proven what you\'ve stated in your introduction paragraph within your essay.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Venn Diagram</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It\'s very important that you are doing everything you can to make the compare and contrast essay that you are writing the best essay that you can. One way that you can help make sure that it\'s a great essay is to follow the Venn diagram.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Venn diagram</strong> is one that shows two circles that overlap each other<em>.</em> It\'s a great representation of how your compare and contrast essay should be structured. In one circle you would have one topic, and you will have the other topic shown in the other circle. Where the circles are separate you will want to show where the topics are different from each other. Where the two circles overlap and have space that is shared you will show where the two topics are similar to each other.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Venn diagram is a great <strong>visual aid</strong> to what your compare and contrast essay should be. You should make sure that within you essay you are showing the two topics and how they are similar to each other and how they are different from each other.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why is it better to hire a professional writing service?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Compare and contrast essays are different from a lot of essays you may have written before.

After a brief introduction to the topic (ate the end of the first paragraph), you need to present an exact and clear thesis statement, submitting your arguments to the reader in a concise manner.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A thesis statement</strong> <em>is a sentence that states the key claim of writing a research paper and helps control the ideas within the paper. </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>&bull;&nbsp;</strong>The statement captures your attitude to the topic and gives the reader a sense of direction on what to expect from the entire paper.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&bull;&nbsp;</strong>It\'s not a fact or opinion, but rather it\'s an assertion based on the writer\'s ideas.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&bull;&nbsp;</strong>Thesis statement acts as a roadmap to the argument you will subsequently develop, helping to lead the readers into the body of the paper.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Types of Thesis Statements</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The type of thesis statement depends on the kind of paper you are writing. This include:<br /><br /></p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n<li><strong>Analytical thesis statement</strong> &ndash; stating what subject will be considered and how it will be evaluated.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n<li><strong>Expository thesis statement</strong> &ndash; explaining the aspects of a topic by placing them in the discussing order</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n<li><strong>Argumentative thesis statement</strong> &ndash; creating an argument by taking a claim on the subject and showing how you support it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why Is It Important in the Academic Writing?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A competent thesis statement serves many functions that include:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Acts as a writing planning tool (thesis statement as a guide to the structure of the paper, which helps the writer stay focused and organized)</p>\r\n<p>2. Helps focus on the subject of the research and clarifies your ideas (thesis statement will contribute to summarize the main point of the paper)</p>\r\n<p>3. Engages the readers in your argument (thesis statement captures a reader\'s attention and creates a picture in the reader\'s mind about the entire research)</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Formulating a Thesis Statement</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here are some strategies to help you create a powerful thesis statement.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li>\r\n<h4><strong>Preliminary Thesis Statement</strong></h4>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Remember that thesis statement will be evolving as your paper progresses. Before writing a paper, you need to have a basic idea of your thesis but be open to change and revise as with more research, comes ongoing discovery that must be included.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li>\r\n<h4><strong>Know the topic</strong></h4>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Gather the appropriate information and clarify possible relationships between the facts while bringing out the weight of such relationships. Be conversant with the topic as it \'s difficult to write a thesis statement on a subject you aren\'t familiar with. Doing further research and reflecting on personal experiences will help you gather more evidence about the topic.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li>\r\n<h4><strong>Narrow it Down</strong></h4>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Your thesis should be limited to what can be discussed in a specified number of pages. Being too general will lead to leaving out so much information and you will end up having done little or nothing at all. For example writing a statement about a topic such as, \'challenges within the community college system in San Diego\' can be narrowed to \'challenge of community colleges in San Diego being so close together geographically, that they tend to duplicate programs and conflict with each other\'.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li>\r\n<h4><strong>Use the formula Claim + Reason = Thesis Statement</strong></h4>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A strong thesis statement will take a stand and justify the claim you present.

Research papers will have the topic or <a title=\"Thesis Statement\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-research-paper/thesis-statement\">thesis statements</a>, pages of citations, and extensive paragraphs full of all of the supporting facts. In many cases, there will be specific <a title=\"Research Paper Guideline\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-research-paper/guideline\">research paper guidelines</a> someone needs to do for a research paper. Research papers will also have guidelines related to the thesis statements and topics.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-research-paper/research-paper-topics\">110 GREAT RESEARCH PAPER TOPICS</a></strong></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In many cases, research papers more or less serve as a showcase for the research that someone has done on a particular topic, and portions of research papers will more or less summarize huge chunks of the research that someone did. It is the job of the writer to bring order to the huge collection of research and to find some way to bring it all together, giving all of this information structure and using it to support an overarching idea.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Format for a Research Paper</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Margins.</strong>&nbsp;The specific guidelines related to a research paper will usually vary from professor to professor or teacher to teacher. However, there are usually limitations on the margins of the pages. Margins are less important in an age where no one writes research papers by hand. However, people will usually be limited to margins of one inch or so in order to avoid a situation where people make the margins bigger to artificially inflate the page count.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Page Count.</strong> Research papers will typically have page count requirements, and people often try to find a way around those. Teachers usually have to find some way to eliminate the most common tricks. Naturally, having overly wide or overly narrow margins makes a document much less readable. Having a certain number of characters on a particular page in a document makes the entire piece much more readable, and guidelines for the margins are built in recognition of that fact.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Research Paper Structure.</strong> Most research papers will have title pages that just inform the reader of the title, the writer, and the date on which the paper was written. After that, people have the body of the paper. Then, writers will have to include their Works Cited pages that list all of the sources that they used. In some cases, people will also have to include the works that they consulted, even if they did not actually use all of their research in the paper. Some Works Cited pages will be longer than others.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Page Numbers.</strong> Research papers will typically have numbered pages since most of them should be long enough to demonstrate a large breadth of information. Placing the page numbers in the center of the document makes more sense in most cases, although some teachers might prefer the page numbers to be aligned to the left or the right edge of the paper for whatever reason.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Paragraph Numbers.</strong> In some cases, people will need to number paragraphs. However, numbering paragraphs tends to affect the readability of a document, and not all teachers will require it. Coming up with subheadings for the different paragraphs will often work better.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Spacing.</strong>&nbsp;Requirements for spacing vary. Indentations for paragraphs were once required. However, these kinds of indentations are less common in the Information Age. Many modern teachers might just ask people to skip one line between paragraphs in order to signify paragraph breaks, which is more similar to what people will see on the Internet today and more similar to the documents that students are likely to encounter at a later date.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some teachers will require double spacing. Usually, double spacing and spacing between paragraphs are going to be considered overkill, but the requirements for the format of a research paper are always going to vary.&nbsp;All of the normal rules about spacing between words apply with research papers. There needs to be a space between the words in a document. However, there might be some specific rules about the spacing involving citations. Some teachers require people to put the citation before a period in a sentence, and other teachers require people to put the period before the citation. There really are no generic guidelines for this sort of thing.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">APA and MLA Formats</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">APA and MLA formats are similar in nature. Different professors and teachers may have different requirements regarding the use of APA and MLA formats. APA formatting is more common for formal academic writing, and the majority of papers that people will write during high school, college, and graduate school will just use MLA formatting. MLA formatting is more casual.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One distinguishing feature is that the APA style does not use footnotes. People just use in-text citations for the APA style of formatting. The in-text citations will then correspond to the Works Cited pages at the end of the document. People can use endnotes or footnotes in the MLA style. However, the MLA style can also involve simple in-text citations as well.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The formatting of the citations themselves will vary between the APA style of formatting and the MLA style of formatting. These style guidelines actually change, so people should stay up-to-date with the current standards for the formatting. Many of these styles will go back and forth with regards to how to cite a website, for instance, in accordance with the changes to the Internet that have occurred over the years.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Professional Research Papers</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">People can search for a research paper template or order research paper samples for many different reasons. For one thing, many people tend to learn by example. Understanding the concept is one thing, but actually being able to see the concept embodied in an example can make the concept much easier for people to understand. No one should have to leave something as important as a research paper to chance, and people should use as many learning tools as they can. A professional research paper writing service can make all the difference in that regard.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-research-paper/research-paper-outline\">RESEARCH PAPER OUTLINE</a></strong></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">OZessay.com.au gives people great work even on short notice.

The student is supposed to express their opinion on a given topic and provide evidence that supports it. The evidence is obtained from different scholarly sources and compiled in an orderly manner. There are two types of research papers students can write:</p>\r\n<p><strong>REASON 1. </strong>Argumentative research paper where the student takes a specified stand on the topic from the beginning of the paper and attempts to persuade the reader to take the same stand.</p>\r\n<p><strong>REASON 2. </strong>Analytical research paper where the student asks a question and tries to answer throughout the paper. The student gives their opinion on the particular topic and does not try to persuade the reader to have the same view.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Research papers are a requirement for one to complete their college or university program. Through writing research papers, students get to learn more about a given subject. Students are also asked to write research papers to make them aware of the different documentation styles accepted and the ethics of research. They also learn the importance of scholarly writing, and it opens their mind to become more logical in their thinking. Students learn how to collect information from different sources, analyze it and present their arguments in an orderly manner. They also learn how to determine whether the information is useful or not and work promptly.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Oceanography</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&bull;

However, no matter the purpose of the research paper, it is important to note that it is never as simple and straightforward as regurgitating someone else&rsquo;s research because it demands original thought to go along with what the writer has been reading.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So if you have a&nbsp;research paper that needs to be done, feel free to email us the assignment criteria or <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Writing Help\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">visit our order page to place your order</a></strong> from there. <strong><em>OZessay</em></strong> is the service you can trust!</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Structure of the Research Paper</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"margin: 5px auto; display: block;\" title=\"Research Paper Writing\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/oz-research-paper.jpg\" alt=\"Like most forms of writing, a research paper should begin with an outline to serve as its skeleton, which can be fleshed out piece-by-piece as the writer continues to research and think about their research. Generally speaking, an outline should start with a strong focus so that the rest of the research paper will not meander, but it is important to note that analytical and argumentative research papers tend to do better with different structures.\" width=\"650\" height=\"200\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For example, the outline of an <strong>analytical research paper should have these steps</strong>:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">1. A statement of the issue that will be analyzed in the research paper, which should come with a description of its context as well as its importance in its field.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Research papers based on original research will need a section on how that original research was carried out, thus providing the readers with a way to tell whether it can be trusted or not as well as how much it can be trusted.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">3. The list of the research used for the research paper, which will be used to create the background that readers will need in order to make sense of the analysis. Research chosen for this section should not create a comprehensive overview of the field but remain focused on the parts that are most relevant to the issue.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">4. Once the list of research has been compiled, the outline will then need to describe the general details of the analysis that will be written by using the information collected through said resources. Like the list of research, the information brought up here should be focused on the issue being analyzed so as to maintain both the reader&rsquo;s interest and the research paper&rsquo;s persuasive strength.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">5. Finally, the outline will mention the research paper&rsquo;s conclusion, which should repeat the statement in the opening while also using summarizing the analysis to serve as support. Some research papers provide recommendations for further reading, which should be listed here for ease of use.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In contrast, an <strong>argumentative research paper would benefit from something more along these lines</strong>:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">1. Its outline should start with the all-important thesis statement, which should be the focus of the research paper. Bear in mind that the thesis statement of an argumentative research paper should be an opinion about a particular issue in a particular field rather than a factual examination of the research that can be found. However, it should still be made using nothing but the information collected from the appropriate resources.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Each supporting premise for the thesis statement should receive its own section in the outline. Said section should include the supporting premise as well as the research that will be used to back it up in the research paper. Furthermore, each section should include the most common counter-arguments to the supporting premise as well as counter-arguments to those counter-arguments to make it as unassailable as possible.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">3. Finally, the outline of an argumentative research paper should have a conclusion that is similar but not quite the same as the outline of an analytical research paper. Its conclusion should still have the thesis statement, but it will need to summarize the supporting premises rather than an analysis that does not exist.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva;\">How to Write a Successful Research Paper</strong></h3>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"margin: 5px auto; display: block;\" title=\"Research Paper Writing Tips\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/research-paper-tips.jpg\" alt=\"To write a successful research paper, you should choose the right topic, research it, make an outline, organize your notes, actually write your paper, edit and proofread it\" width=\"650\" height=\"503\" /></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here are some further suggestions that can be used to write a successful research paper:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The first step is choosing the right topic. Generally speaking, research paper writers should write about something that interests them since that will provide them with the motivation needed to put in the time and effort needed to ensure excellent results. In fact, research paper writers should not hesitate to change their topic so long as there is enough time remaining for them to make the change without sacrificing the excellence of the results.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The second step is to research the topic using a wide range of resources. Common places to start searching range from the libraries to the academic databases that can be found online. As research paper writers become more and more certain about what they want to write, they should start focusing their readings more and more on a particular issue in order to get the more usefulness out of their efforts.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once research paper writers have settled on a particular issue and conducted a fair amount of research into their chosen topic, they can start coming up with an outline that will guide their writing. Bear in mind that they should have a thesis statement to serve as a focus by this point in time plus an intended audience so that they know how they should write as well as how much information they should provide to serve as the necessary background. Furthermore, they should continue making changes to their outlines as they continue researching their issue and thinking about their approach.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is probably the best time to organize the notes, which means sorting the notes for ease of use, coming up with annotations for the information that will be used, and creating a preliminary bibliography that will be revised once the actual writing on the research paper starts.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once the planning is complete, research paper writers can start on the actual writing. Generally speaking, people like to write from start to finish, but for a research paper, it might be better for them to start with the body before moving onto the conclusion and then the introduction. This is important because completing the body with the analysis and the argument tells them exactly what they should include in the conclusion and the introduction in order to create a coherent document. Once these steps have been completed, a research paper should receive the appropriate citations so that readers will know where to check if they want to confirm the statements made in its paragraphs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Finally, a research paper should be edited. In part, this means going through the writing to check for spelling errors and grammatical mistakes. However, research paper writers should also have someone read their work to make sure that what makes sense to them makes sense to readers as well. A research paper cannot be considered complete without incorporating the corrections from the editing process, so much so that significant rewrites should have their own editing processes.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Useful Services For Writing a Research Paper</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are a number of useful resources for research paper writers. For example, both instructors and librarians can point them to the right resources, while their friends can make excellent proofreaders. Furthermore, examples of research papers can be found throughout the Internet, which can tell them more about what they should and should not do when writing their research papers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, if they are interested in assistance with research topics on their chosen topics, there are few options that are as useful as research paper writing services, which can provide them with a custom-made example to serve as a guide for their own efforts. While guidelines are genuinely useful for those seeking to write a research paper, seeing the finished product can bring them together like nothing else for people who are struggling with their research papers.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Research Papers by OZessay</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We are proud to offer the best research papers in the academic services industry.

Scholarships can be need based or merit based, and whatever the case it is called to ease up the financial strain associated with your prospective studies. In order to receive a scholarship, you will need to <strong>persuade the committee</strong> that you are worth it, that you really deserve it and that you are better than other applicants. This is normally done via a scholarship essay &ndash; very rarely do prospective students receive scholarships simply based on their academic record or recommendations.</p>\r\n<h3>Why Are Scholarship Essays Important?</h3>\r\n<p>College scholarship essay competitions actually serve to level out players from different backgrounds and accomplishment levels. Therefore 99% of all scholarship awarding institutions will require applicants to submit a well thought-out and substantially written essay.</p>\r\n<h3>How to Write a Scholarship Essay?</h3>\r\n<p>Experts in the field of writing scholarship essays are unanimous in saying several criteria that are important for successful essay writing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Before even starting to write make sure you understand what you are expected to write in your essay. There can&rsquo;t be a one-essay-fits-all approach where you write one essay and email it over to all the institutions, expecting it to win everywhere, you are wrong. Every institution you apply to will set its own requirements to your essay. Make sure you understand requirements and write to meet them fully. This doesn&rsquo;t mean, however, that you can have a draft that can further be transformed into a full-scale essay tailored to answer a specific question.</li>\r\n<li>Thorough preparation. One should not underestimate the importance of essay writing. Treating scholarship essays as a formality is a fatal approach to getting a scholarship. This type of assignment is different from other essays you have written during your school years &ndash; you&rsquo;ve got to show what makes you special and why you should be given this money. If you turn things around a little bit, you could say that you are writing for money, and if it&rsquo;s done properly, you will be paid for writing your essay!&nbsp; Experts agree that normally 2-3 weeks are required to collect ideas and structure them properly.</li>\r\n<li>Use the pre-writing-writing-post-writing approach. This approach means that you should create a draft first, and then keep working on to improve it further. Once you see or think that you are ready with a paper, leave it for a week or two and then come back to it to polish it further. You will sure have something to add. Check for spelling and grammar errors, pay close attention to the style and the way the paper flows.</li>\r\n<li>Your scholarship essay should emanate enthusiasm and passion about the subject. If you are not enthusiastic about what you are writing, chances are &ndash; your essay is not going to make it. In this way, the essay you are working on is different from all other essays that were a formality. You will have hundreds of other essays to beat, so make sure yours really stands out.</li>\r\n<li>How does your paper reflect your personality? Remember, you will have hundreds of essays to beat, so simply enumerating the classes you took and the extracurricular activities you participated in won&rsquo;t help. Tell your reader what events have impacted your personality and contributed to who you are now. Show that you care for the future of the world, you are not indifferent to people around you, tell what inspires you and what makes you enthusiastic.</li>\r\n<li>Limit your paper to 300-500 words, unless instructed otherwise by the funding institution. Typically, though, the essay should be a brief description of who you are as opposed to a resume (which should be included in your documents separately).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In your scholarship essay, you will need to <strong>keep a balance</strong> of telling the committee about yourself and showing your experience. The task is not to oversell yourself while showing a variety of your personal, social and academic interests. Good GPA would be a good starting point; however, your extracurricular activities, like active social work and participation in sports/art teams of your high school will increase the odds for a congratulations letter from the scholarship committee.</p>\r\n<p>If you have a scholarship essay to write, OZessay.com.au is the right place to get help.

If it&rsquo;s your case, and instead of finding a guided essay writing tips, you find something like Naplan writing marking guide or cursive writing guide, this time you are at the right place. Our professional writers have prepared a detailed information in the form of a guide - writing an essay will become much more easier if you read the tips below. So, the guided writing tips from our experts include:</p>\r\n<p>1. Choose a topic or get an idea about the one you have been provided: Get an idea about the topic you have and what points to include. The topic can either be a general overview or a specific one. If it\'s specific, ensure that the analysis is precise and only about that specific point, for a general overview topic like `FOOD`, you can subdivide into certain subtopics. The subtopics to include can be `vegetables` or fruits`.</p>\r\n<p>2. Organize your ideas: Organize on how you will write your ideas in the essay, however, the structure on how you will organize the ideas or point can change according to the flow of the essay. You can choose to put it down in a diagram to get a clear overview on how your points will be detailed.</p>\r\n<p>3. Create a thesis statement: After getting an idea or point to put forth in your essay, you can now write a thesis statement. The thesis statement informs the reader what the essay is all about and what you as a writer have provided in the essay. Your thesis point will be in two main parts, that is the topic and the point of the essay. On the point of the essay part of the thesis, the ideas or points to include depends on the size of the essay, however, the points should be in summary form and they should, therefore, be few. Once you are comfortable with your thesis and you have all the points to include in the essay, you can move to the next step.</p>\r\n<p>4. Write the body: In this part, you will describe, explain and dispute your topic in a detailed manner. Each idea will be now in paragraphs, which translate to four or five paragraphs if you had four or five ideas. Start by summarizing each idea in sentence form, then write the supporting ideas and clearly elaborate them. Then after explaining each of the main ideas, move on to the next step.</p>\r\n<p>5. Always ensure you have a good introduction and conclusion. On the introductory part, always ensure it grabs the attention of the reader. That can be done by writing the points that will make the reader seek more information in your essay and continue with another two more inviting sentences.</p>\r\n<p>6. Add the final touches: that includes ensuring that the essay is in the correct format as well as the formatting is properly followed. Also read out your essay to ensure that the grammar is good.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"../../five-paragraph-essay\">FIVE-PARAGRAPH ESSAY</a></h4>\r\n<p>The above essay writing tips will be quite beneficial for you to have a clear and an excellent essay.

The introduction contains a thesis statement and the body paragraphs present the arguments and supporting evidence that are set to prove the thesis.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As you do your research, take the time to revisit your outline often. You may find some ideas need more information to flesh them out and others you will find are dead ends. Keeping in touch with your outline during the research phase will help keep you on track and in line with your paper&rsquo;s purpose.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Each time you make a significant edit to your outline, test each point you add for its clarity, and test each structural change to see if the paper still makes a convincing case toward its conclusion. The final outline should cover all the main points that were posed in the thesis statement.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once you have a detailed outline, the next step is to organize your information in a way that it clearly proves your thesis through facts, quotes and empirical evidence. To accomplish that, you must back up the facts and explain all of your conclusions drawn from facts. Organize the paper by using each body paragraph to state, verify and explain one fact that supports the thesis.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">What is the purpose of a term paper?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As a writer, you should be aiming to expand the reader&rsquo;s knowledge beyond that which they would glean from the source material. The typical term paper takes on the ultimate purpose to:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Research and investigate a topic deeply, using trustworthy materials.</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Synthesize information from several sources to uncover patterns and relationships where they weren&rsquo;t previously seen.</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Organize materials from many sources into one curated body of writing.</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Analyze the work by critiquing the evidence, validity, logic, and flaws behind their ideas and arguments.</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Clarify to make challenging or confusing material understandable for even a layman.</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Examine the topic in another context, or apply the learning to another place or time for a broader perspective.</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Edit voraciously for fluff that does not add to the core idea.</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Adopt a point of view and show that evidence weighs heavier on one side in a controversial issue.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Term paper writing tips</h2>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">General tips</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">1.An average length (10-20 pages) should take about one month to adequately collect the materials and lay them out in a finished paper.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">2.Create a schedule to help you keep track of time: list the days you have left and the time during the day you&rsquo;ll be able to work. Even if you have two weeks until the due date, you may be surprised at home few hours you have free.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">3.Get a library card. There is no way to do the kind of deep research necessary for a term paper just through online sources.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">4.Limit yourself to having only 10-15% of your finished paper made of quotations.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">5.Use the correct dictionary, as requested by your professor&mdash;there is a difference!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">6.Read drafts aloud to catch awkward phrasing. If you stumble on something while reading, rework it.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Thesis statement tips</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">1.Keep it simple and as specific as possible.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">2.Take your thesis to your professor or supervisor for their opinion.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Taking notes</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">1.Use a color or index card system to code your paper research notes. Do a quick Google search and choose a research coding system that seems right for you.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">2.Take note of ever source you pull, including the author&rsquo;s name, the publication date and the page numbers you used. Even if you just took away one little note.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Outline</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">1.Set up the wording of your thesis statement carefully. Certain wording could drastically change where you can go with your research. Example: To theorize that Othello is a play about love and jealousy is far too broad of a subject and will overwhelm you with research sources and previous essays on the subject.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">2.For each point you make in the body, make about three points proving its validity.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">3.Write your first draft close to the outline but as freely as possible. Don&rsquo;t get bogged down by thinking of the reader&rsquo;s perspective yet.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The dos and don&rsquo;ts of term paper writing</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Do\'s and Don\'ts of Term Paper Writing\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/term-paper-writing-tips.jpg\" alt=\"When you write your term paper you should: start writing as early as possible, try to explain the ideas in your own words, explore your own ideas and insights through writing, but avoid getting too stylistic and use the process to clarify your own ideas and understand the world around you.

Or the assignment is submitted to an open pool of writers to be picked up by the next available writer.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">4.Agree to some terms and submit payment.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">5.Receive a page that outlines your order and serves as an agreement between you and your writer that the work will be done to you specifications in the time allotted.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">6.Communicate with your writer through an online messaging service. If your writer has any questions along the way, this is how they will submit those queries. Keep an eye on your inbox so you can keep everything moving smoothly and efficiently.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">7.Wait for the paper to be delivered by the deadline you specified.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">8.Request revisions if necessary. Sometimes those revisions will incur an additional cost.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why is it better to use term paper writing services?</h2>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Confidential service</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You are hiring a writer not only to produce your work but to back away from the work once it&rsquo;s handed over. They will not steal or use your paper under their own name and they will not disclose their hand in its creation. A good online paper writing service will provide non-disclosure agreements to confirm the understanding of this by both parties.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Scope of work</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Most term paper writing services can help you write nearly anything: biographies, memoirs, family or corporate histories, website copy, fiction, scripts and blogs.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Reasonable prices</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Term paper writers charge by the word and a good writer won&rsquo;t add fluff just to increase their payout. If you are on a budget, you can have a writer do the majority of the research and layout while you polish and edit the work.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Speedy service</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Professional writers are being paid to focus solely on the work and have it done by a certain deadline.

Dictionaries offer a common dissertation definition: Dissertations are long pieces of writing on a particular topic done by students to receive their Master&rsquo;s or Ph.D. degree. Our writers at OZessay define dissertation as a final document in the stage of an academic degree or a professional qualification that shows research and findings of the finalist. A dissertation proves that you have gained the necessary skills and knowledge to organize and conduct a research project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Need a custom dissertation?

If you don&rsquo;t feel like reading the entire article, <a title=\"Order Page\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">place an order</a> and get your custom written dissertations.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Difference Between a Thesis and a Dissertation</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The words &ldquo;thesis&rdquo; and &ldquo;dissertation&rdquo; are often referred to as the same thing, and it depends on the region or the institution since some prefer thesis on the final Masters Research and dissertation on finalizing Ph.D. They (thesis and dissertation) have almost or the same structure basing on the introduction, literary review, main body, conclusion, bibliography, and appendix.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">How a thesis and a dissertation are defined is dependent on the country or institution that a student is from. Generally, in the US, a thesis refers to a final project for the master\'s students and a dissertation is a final paper to a doctorate. Those studying for masters usually perform research on a particular subject that demonstrates their knowledge acquired throughout their program. Seeking a Ph.D. requires one to write a dissertation which portrays something completely new and undiscovered to your field. This means that the student in question has to contribute original knowledge to the subject. So, the main difference between a thesis and a dissertation is the depth of knowledge you must attain in order to write the paper. Also, what you study is different in the sense that masters tests on the application of knowledge on the final paper and Ph.D. lead to a discovery to be presented in the final paper.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There is some similarity on a master&rsquo;s degree thesis and a research paper done during college completion. What makes it differ from the research paper is the use the research of others to provide your own analysis on your discoveries when developing your thesis. It demonstrates your level of critical and analytical thinking and defines the subject that you are most interested in pursuing within your field. With a dissertation, you are expected to use the research of others only to guide you in your own research to come up with a whole new hypothesis. The idea behind this having analysis and concepts forming the core of the dissertation and experimental data is avoided at all costs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Another way in which the thesis and dissertation differ is in length. A dissertation is twice or even thrice the length of a master&rsquo;s thesis. It is recommended that you consult those providing the guidelines for the proper length of your dissertation or thesis based on what you are undertaking.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/dissertation-help\">Professional Dissertation Help</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/dissertation-proposal-tourism\">Dissertation Proposal on Tourism</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/research-proposal-topics-for-dissertations-or-masters-thesis\">Research Proposal Topics for Your Dissertation or Master\'s Thesis</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/research-paper\">Research Paper Writing</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/writing-term-paper\">Term Paper Writing Guide</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>An Outline of a Dissertation</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A dissertation involves two main aspects:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;<em>&bull; A practical list of what is needed.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>&nbsp;</em><em>&bull; A sketch of what to write.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">First, there is a list that comprehensively displays the items that you can use as the basis of your own to-do list. Writing your to-do list is the easiest part of your dissertation. The tasks are arranged roughly in the order that you&rsquo;re likely to do them, although some of the tasks will depend on others to be done first.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Second, the outline needs to show your thoughts and ideas clearly on what is to be included in each section of your dissertation. Sketching out what you need to say and structuring the presentation of your thoughts and ideas can be done in a number of ways. Two of the popular methods are linear planning and concept planning. People often have strong feelings about which style they prefer; each method has pros and cons.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you find creating an outline a useful part of your planning, it&rsquo;s a good idea to use the same outline style for each chapter. This helps you to write a dissertation with a clear, tight structure and avoiding repetition and confusion. A well-structured outline leads to a coherent dissertation.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Don&rsquo;t apply your plan as if it is fixed &ndash; a good dissertation develops as you&rsquo;re working on it and you&rsquo;ve no need to be afraid of moving slightly away from your original plans. If you&rsquo;re going wildly off track, however, seek support from your supervisor before messing up your whole plan.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Skills Acquired and Tested\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/custom-dissertation.png\" alt=\"Identifying, setting, organizing, analyzing and drawing conclusions\" width=\"820\" height=\"375\" /></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Use Linear Planning For Your Dissertation</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When using linear planning, list your tasks in the order of doing them prioritizing the important ones first. Linear planning makes for a very clear outline, but it&rsquo;s harder to make changes as you go along than with a concept map. For your linear plan you can use the chapter headings recommended by your supervisor or the headings in the following list:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Linear Planning of the Dissertation\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/research-paper-outline.png\" alt=\"Introduction, definitions. a conceptual model, research methodologies, main evidences and supporters, conclusions, appendices and bibliography\" width=\"820\" height=\"1000\" /></p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Dissertation Writing Tips</h2>\r\n<p>Here are a few tips that you can consider in the course of writing the dissertation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The easiest way to build your content is doing it inside out. Start with the chapters that describe your research.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Take the terms as they come and keep a definition for each.</li>\r\n<li>As stated earlier, definitions should be in a separate chapter, and they should be precise and formal.</li>\r\n<li>The only way to make it in writing a successful dissertation is practicing, reading a lot on the particular topics and practicing again &ndash; no shortcuts in this.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;ts</h2>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Dos:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">- <em>Talk to your advisor or committee soon and often.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you have any questions related to the thesis proposal, dissertation format, content, or deadlines, make an effort to contact your thesis advisor or other members of your thesis committee at any time. They are your best resource for most situations.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">-<em> Relax and plan your time.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you really haven&rsquo;t worked that much on your thesis yet, don&rsquo;t panic. You have time to work on a great thesis before graduation, as long as you plan ahead and don&rsquo;t have any anxiety attacks. Make a schedule of experiments, interviews, or research time to help you plan on what you need to do. Don&rsquo;t forget to schedule writing time; this is a project that warrants more than one draft. Sacrificing is vital, so don&rsquo;t take it for granted. And be sure to plan in some time to relax&mdash;gaining energy for more involving work.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Don&rsquo;ts:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>- Don&rsquo;t be a last minute person.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You don&rsquo;t want to be printing the day of your defense when the paper runs out, or the printer goes on the fritz. Also, make sure you know as soon as you can about the different sections of your thesis. Most theses proposals and theses call for a brief introduction of the project, and you can help yourself with the following questions:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; How long should yours be?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Who is your intended audience?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Do you need a bibliography?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Do you need a table of contents?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; A section for graphs or charts?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Again, consult your thesis advisor. Just make sure you ask soon since preparation at the last minute will have your thesis canceled due to improper structuring, and furthermore, you never created room for consultation.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Spelling and Grammar</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>- Don&rsquo;t underestimate the importance of spell checking and pay particular attention to the spellings of key names and theories. Make sure your use of capital letters is both correct and consistent.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Self-assessment</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>- Don&rsquo;t use self-assessment statements that pose as a form of praise or criticism. Avoid statements like &ldquo;this method shows a breakthrough&hellip;.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;this technique is not well revised&hellip;&rdquo; and such other statements.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Voice</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>- Don&rsquo;t use passive voice in your writing. Instead, use active voice always.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A dissertation must adhere to impeccable writing standards, especially with the grammar and vocabulary. A doctoral level or master&rsquo;s level dissertation must not have any spelling mistakes and must be properly <a title=\"Proofreading\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/proofreading\">proofread</a>.

The first paragraph introduces the idea or topic to the reader. The next several paragraphs support that idea by presenting compelling thoughts or facts to substantiate, or back up, the idea. The final paragraph provides a concluding statement that reinforces the original idea given in the introduction.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Essay Prompts</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a style=\"font-size: medium;\" title=\"Custom Essay Writing\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-essays\">Custom essay writing</a>, as a form, is an essential tool that can provide any student with a powerful method of communicating with the surrounding world. The basics of essay writing are taught as early as a primary school because knowing how to form a basic argument is such a critical component of communication. While an essay can be extremely personal and be written directly from an individual\'s point of view in the first person, most academic essays have different requirements. Essays are typically written in third-person and can be highly subjective or unilaterally objective if based completely on facts.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Essay Types</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Generally, there are four main categories of essay types, including:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li><a title=\"Argumentative Essay\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/argumentative-essay-writing-service\">Argumentative</a></li>\r\n<li><a title=\"Reflective Essay\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/reflective-essay\">Reflective Essay</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"../../descriptive-essay\">Descriptive</a></li>\r\n<li><a title=\"Critical Essay\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/critical-essay\">Critical</a></li>\r\n<li><a title=\"Classification Essay\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/classification-essay\">Classification</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Within each type of essay-writing category are various subtypes, including definition, compare and contrast, cause and effect, and critical essays among others. There are many other subtypes of custom essay writing because any idea, subject or topic can be given written form through an essay. So, if a writer is intrigued by visual art, an essay could be presented as an artistic critique or evaluation. If a writer wishes to investigate a scientific phenomenon and present their findings through the form of an essay, the subtype may be categorized as scientific evaluation. If a writer wishes to respond to a presented subject through essay writing, the essay could be considered as a type of feedback.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Essentially, the list of potential essay subtypes is extensive. However, this also broadens the writing arena, allowing many different types of writing approaches and interesting perspectives. Based on the given requirements of what the writer chooses or needs to express, essay writing methods can be very diverse and take many different routes.

For example, a marketing and/or management paper would be also referred to as a &lsquo;business essay&rsquo; because of its direct relation to business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Functions of Business Essay</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Business essay writing pursues the same objectives as regular essay writing and some of them are:</p>\r\n<p><strong>&bull;&nbsp;</strong>Practice managing your time effectively<br /><strong>&bull;&nbsp;</strong>Further develop writing skills<br /><strong>&bull;&nbsp;</strong>Practice writing skills and critical thinking<br /><strong>&bull;&nbsp;</strong>Learn to convince other people<br /><strong>&bull;&nbsp;</strong>Learn to apply knowledge and skills from classes &nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What It Takes to Write a Good Business Essay</h3>\r\n<p>When it comes to writing a good business essay, there really no special secret - all it takes is thorough preparation, planning and careful composition with a meticulous follow up. The entire&nbsp;writing process is often described as <em>prewriting</em> -&gt; <em>writing</em> -&gt; <em>post-writing</em> phases. For those of you who are unfamiliar with these stages, here is their basic breakdown:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Pre-writing</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Pre-writing is all about preparation and planning. Before you actually start writing something, you need to think what you are going to write about, how you are going to structure your business essay, what materials and data you are going to use in the paper, how you are going to answer the question etc. All these ideas will need to be put to paper to give an essay its basic structure. It doesn\'t have to be neat and tidy at this stage - the purpose of this phase is to plan and to retain all the important ideas. Pre-writing doesn\'t like to be rushed, all ideas need to be properly structured and well thought out.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Writing</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Following the pre-writing stage is the writing one. Once you are ready with your thoughts (or have a rough draft), you should put them to paper. The essay writing process prescribes that an essay should take a fairly rigid structure and consist of an introduction, two-three body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The introduction should present the main idea to the reader, body paragraphs break up the \'big idea\' into smaller ones and dwell on each of them in detail, while the conclusion sums up the entire essay. When writing your first draft we recommend that you pay attention to all details like spelling, grammar, punctuation etc. Even though you will give your business essay several editing touches in the post-writing phase, it might get difficult for you to spot them immediately. If your essay needs referencing, you can use our <a title=\"APA Format Citation Machine\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/references-generator/apa-format-citation-machine\">APA citation machine</a> that will do the formatting for you automatically!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Post-Writing</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The point of doing the post-writing phase lies in proofreading and finalizing the essay. The critical nuance to this stage is that the essay should be put aside for a while (at least for a day or too). Thoughts tend to set it over that period of time, and after a few days, you might decide to reshape your essay a little. Together with giving your essay these few final touches, you should also proofread and spellcheck your paper. Once your business essay passes the scrutiny of the post-writing phase, it is ready for submission.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">General pricing plan for the Custom Business Essay writing is as follows (prices are in Australian dollars, cost per page) #get_view(\'blocks/prices1.php\')</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"Place an Order\" href=\"../../order\" rel=\"nofollow\">ORDER YOUR CUSTOM-WRITTEN BUSINESS ESSAY TODAY!</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/man-is-looking-at-papers.jpg\" alt=\"Man Is Looking at Papers\" width=\"650\" height=\"370\" /></p>','Business Management Essay Writing Guide from OZessay Pro-Writers','','publish','closed','closed','','business-essay','','','2017-05-23 14:17:01','2017-05-23 11:17:01','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(158,1,'2013-10-25 12:21:05','2013-10-25 09:21:05','','business_management_essay_ozessay','','inherit','closed','closed','','business_management_essay_ozessay','','','2017-05-23 14:17:01','2017-05-23 11:17:01','',157,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/images/article/og/business_management_essay_ozessay.jpg?v=1495538198',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(159,1,'2013-10-29 14:12:07','2013-10-29 12:12:07','<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"float: left; margin: 5px;\" title=\"Classification Essay\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/classification_essay.png\" alt=\"Classification Essay Writing\" width=\"227\" height=\"259\" />Writing a Division and Classification Essay</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of the different styles of formal writing, the division and classification essay requires the sorting and grouping of specific items or ideas into various categories based on the information or characteristics provided. The well written <strong>classification essay should provide a thorough and meaningful message</strong> about how these different categories relate to one another.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For this reason, classification essay topics should be clear and concise. The perfect topic for a division and classification essay allows for a discussion on how the whole relates to its parts, or vice versa. For example, if writing an article on parenting styles, these four major divisions and classifications could be explored, alone and as a whole: <em>authoritative, neglectful, permissive and authoritarian</em>.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Purpose of a Division and Classification Essay</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The primary goal of the division and classification essay is to break down large subjects into smaller and more specific subtopics for the reader. By creating a more manageable system of classification and division, things can be organised and divided much more quickly and easily, often requiring considerable less thought. These small categories, like subtopics, help the reader understand the individual facets of most classification essay topics more fully.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Structure of a Division and Classification Essay</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When writing a classification essay, the structure must be concise and the information must be grouped into specific and organised categories. This is accomplished using a five paragraph division and classification essay format, consisting of the following parts: an<strong> introduction</strong>,three or more paragraphs which constitutes the <strong>body</strong>, and a <strong>conclusion</strong></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">OZessay provides professional writing services, including background research, writing, proofreading &amp; editing papers.

In the body of a classification essay, there should be at least three or more paragraphs, each one dedicated to a singular topic within a specific category that relates to the introduction.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Much like a summary, the conclusion reiterates the information that was given in the introduction, and sums up the supporting information provided in the body of the division and classification essay. The reader&rsquo;s questions should be fully answered by the time he has read the entire conclusion.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Connection Words and Phrases for Classification Essay Topics</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Connection words are very much like signal phrases, as both let the reader know when a transition is occurring within the text of a division and classification essay. These very clear and concise signals warn the reader that there will be new information divided and categorised in the next statement. While there are plenty more, some of the most commonly used connection phrases for classification essay topics include the following:&nbsp;<em>classified according to, in this category, this type of, several kinds of, can be divided into, is categorised by.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Additionally, these signal phrases lend both unity and flow to the abstract categories of a classification essay, allowing the writer to reveal and communicate something that is meaningful and has value.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">References</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://www.cengage.co.uk/\">Cengage Learning</a></strong><br />&bull; <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://www.wju.edu/\">Wheeling Jesuit University</a></strong><br />&bull; <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://www.apsu.edu/\">Austin Peay State University</a></strong></p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">10 Tips for a Successful Division and Classification Essay</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Only a small portion of students actually enjoy writing essays. That is simply because writing essays is quite difficult for most people, requiring hours of research and hard work - and that&rsquo;s before the writing process ever begins. The division and classification essay ranks as one of the most important assignments that most students will ever face.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Critical thinking skills and the ability to write proficiently are necessary requirements for future careers and employment opportunities. Here are some insightful writing tips for composing the division and classification essay, or to assist with other writing assignments.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">#1 - Choosing Classification Essay Topics</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The savvy essay writer chooses the assigned division and <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Tip: How to Invent a Catchy Topic for a Classification Essay\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/classification-essay/topics-samples\">classification topics</a></strong> that are familiar as well as interesting, lending greater detail and understanding to the subtopics or categories.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">#2 - Don&rsquo;t Delay</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once the assignment is given, writers should immediately begin the process of choosing the best classification essay topics, budgeting time, and forming a clear plan of action.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">#3 - Make an Outline</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Just as one might need a list to stay focused at the grocery store, it is important to write an outline to help with inserting the most vital facts into the essay. When finished, the outline should reflect all of the points that need to be made.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">#4 - Write the First Draft</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is not likely that the first draft will contain all of the information needed to hand in for a grade. There will be additional points to include later, and others that will need to be omitted. Multiple drafts may be needed before the essay is ready to be graded by an instructor.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">#5 - Understand the Assignment</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Writers should be sure to ask any questions about the assignment early on, long before the division and classification essay deadline. It is not wise to wait until the last minute.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">#6 - Seek Out Examples</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For clarification, there are numerous example classification essays available online for comparison. These are a great way for writers to see what is expected from the assignment.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">#7 - Never Plagiarise</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">While quotes or citations are acceptable, under no circumstances should the writer ever &lsquo;borrow&rsquo; someone else&rsquo;s words. Essays are considered to be intellectual property, owned by the composer.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">#8 - Format Correctly</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Don&rsquo;t fall victim to poor formatting, which can result in a considerable loss of grade points. Take the time to go over formatting requirements and refer to online sources if there are unanswered questions.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">#9 - Cite Sources</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Citing sources is a vital part of any formal essay unless the instructions suggest otherwise, and time spent on this aspect of the essay is necessary for a desirable grade. Incorrectly citing the sources used is nearly as bad as plagiarizing someone else&rsquo;s work.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">#10 - Put the Essay Away</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once the final essay has been written with plenty of time to spare before the assignment&rsquo;s due date, put it away and take some time to clear your mind. After a few days, read and review the essay again. If everything appears to be in order, the essay is ready to be handed in.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">In Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is important to take essays seriously as these assignments weigh heavily in grades. Poorly written essays or late assignments can easily prevent admission into certain schools or academic programs. Approach all essay and other writing assignments as if your future depends upon the grade you will receive.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Need assistance with a division and classification essay?

That is an essay that will ask you to compare and contrast two things or two items. You should note that while making a comparison, this is not limited to only two things; you could be comparing more than two things at a time. By comparison, this could either mean similarities or similarities and difference. A contrasting essay only means you write the difference.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This kind of essays is meant to encourage you to make connections between ideas and different text. In so doing, you will find that you gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter at hand in comparison to simply summarizing or giving a description of the items that you are will compare and contrast. Comparing objects may be very confusing but our writers are <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Place an Order\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">ready to help you 24/7!</a></strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li><strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"../../essay-structure\">Essay Structure</a></strong></li>\r\n<li><strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"../../five-paragraph-essay\">Five Paragraph Essay</a></strong></li>\r\n<li><strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"../../example-of-a-five-paragraph-essay\">Example of a Five Paragraph Essay</a></strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some of the thing that you may be asked to compare and contrast may include:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Figures. For example, compare the profit company X made in 2014 and 2015 events such as World War 1 and World War 2</em></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Theories such as communism and capitalism</em></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Texts in a book</em></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Basis for Comparison</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before you go ahead to make a list of the similarities and difference that exist, you need to have a clear grasp on the basis of your comparison. If you\'ve been asked to compare between two particular subjects that we have mentioned above, then you can go ahead and make a list of the similarities and differences. If not, then it may be a case where you are required to come up with your own basis for comparison. The basis of your comparison you choose should be based on one of the things that we have mentioned above.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">List down the Similarities and the Difference</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now that you have your basis for comparison, it becomes much easier to list the required similarities and difference. You should note at this point, even though you are being asked to write a comparison essay, it\'s important to note down the differences or contrasting material. That is normally implied. This list doesn\'t quality to be your outline yet, but it should provide you with the initial plan.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Based on the basis for your comparison, evaluate the list. That will help you point out which points best fit the basis of your comparison.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Develop a Thesis</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Developing your thesis will be based on your list of similarities and differences. Do the similarities outweigh the difference, if so, and then this will form your thesis. The vice versa is also true. That simply means that whichever of the two that outweighs the other gets to form the basis of your thesis. A complex thesis will include both the similarities and the difference.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Your thesis statement needs to be very clear and concise.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Comparison Essay Structure</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are two types of essay structure that you can use for your writing. You\'ll either use Block method or Alternating method.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">1. Block Method. It is also referred to as the subject-by-subject pattern. For example, if your basis is on events, A will stand for World War 1 and B will stand for World War 2. You\'ll start off by discussing all of A and then all of B if you\'re to use the block method. You should be careful to point out the similarities and difference despite covering A first and then B. They shouldn\'t be two essays joined as one.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It\'s most useful when you\'re unable to find points on A and B; that are closely related, or you\'re comparing more than two subjects, or your thoughts on B are built from those in A.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Alternating Method. Also known as the point-by-point pattern; as the name suggests, you\'ll alternate your writing between A and B. for example, the first paragraph will be about A and the second paragraph will be on B. They will then keep alternating throughout the essay.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It\'s&nbsp;a&nbsp;method that does a better job in highlighting the similarities and difference and in the end produces a paper that is more integrated and analytical.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Still have questions about comparison essay writing? <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Place an Order\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">Ask our writers or place an order to have your essay written by professionals!</a></p>','Comparison Essay','','publish','closed','closed','','comparison-essay','','','2017-05-17 12:58:02','2017-05-17 09:58:02','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(162,1,'2013-10-29 14:15:12','2013-10-29 12:15:12','','comparison_essay_writing_ozessay','','inherit','closed','closed','','comparison_essay_writing_ozessay','','','2017-05-17 12:58:02','2017-05-17 09:58:02','',161,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/images/article/og/comparison_essay_writing_ozessay.png?v=1495698499',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(163,1,'2013-10-30 15:43:46','2013-10-30 13:43:46','<blockquote> <q>Composing a good cause and effect essay entails following a logical outline, and once you develop the outline, the essay can be quite easy than it might seem.</q> </blockquote><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">What Is a Cause and Effect Essay?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Cause and effect essays usually center on why things occur (causes) and the outcomes of the happenings (effects).

Confirm the strength of the relationships in every effect and cause in your worksheet by analyzing them. This can offer you a better understanding of how the ideas ought to fit together and the topics that you are most comfortable handling.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Create a Stunning Outline</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Firstly, you need to develop an outline for your topic. This will be the starting point of your essay and the \'cause.\' Provide a detailed background of the \'cause\' to make the basis of your essay more understandable by your readers. Establish the structure of your essay from the developed outline.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Brainstorm causes and effects to identify ideal essay topics. It is necessary to generate a general statement to clarify cause-effect in the discussion. You can derive topic structures from these points. To advance your outline, verify first point or statement. Logically list causes, while explaining reasons for the effect to occur. Present detailed list proving the form points beneath the first point. Sign-off with a sentence that connects to the next paragraph.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Repeat the structure for the cause and effect. Offer support details list and scribble a hint into the next paragraph. Insert a conclusion beneath all points so as to tight paragraphs together. You will have a rich essay outline with an informative description, three bold statements; Use form points for causes under their statements, then present a feasible conclusion. You can henceforth write the essay, utilizing your outline as background.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Make an effective Introduction</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A cause-effect essay, typically describes the background of an issue, so as to explain a cause and why to understand its resultant effect is of great importance. You can, however, discuss known effects\' root. The true purpose of an ideal introduction is to diligently unleash the purpose of the essay and further showcase issues at stake. A thesis statement should feature as your introductory paragraph\'s conclusion.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Remember that your conclusion is meant to give a preview of the overall perspective of the essay. Your essay must abide by its underlying thesis statement. For instance, an essay on \'United States Prohibition\' the thesis statement can be outlined as follows: \"Lucrative illegal industry arises from religious groups pressuring the government to enhance prohibition.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Put the general statement of your choice in the thesis and identify points that emphasize to prove your statement. These will serve as your main outline structures.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Come up with Strong Arguments</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Both causes and effects demand that you come up with at least three solid arguments. These will be your essay\'s core points. Elaborate effects related to your event, phenomenon or trend. Be sure to refer regularly to causes so as to make necessary links and connections to aid your audience understand the cause and effect deeply.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Each argument must have back up of 2-3 descriptive, factual statements emphasizing it. For instance, supposing your argument reads \"Violent crime in prohibition era increase feuded by bootleggers,\" you may need to provide statistical crime support in the mentioned era.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Too many points will confuse your reader. You, therefore, need to limit your pillar points to approximately three. There always will exist be multiple causes or effects the diverse relationships that exist, depending on essay length; strive to ensure that the statements are limited to three.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">A Note about your Content</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Depending on points the writer intends to analyze, each essay should employ diverse body paragraphs. Furthermore, body paragraphs end up similar to some degree. Paragraphs should be specific to a given argument in the essay; can be a unique cause of an effect or a unique effect of a cause.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The first sentence of a given paragraph usually combines with the preceding one\'s last sentence, enabling a clear, smooth and frictionless transition. Keep in mind that transitions always isolate a great essay from good ones. The paragraph\'s body content should hence be made via a descriptive, clean analysis of the relationship therein between an effect and its cause.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Sum It Up</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">An essay\'s conclusion is one of the main parts and the one that leaves a lasting impression on your readers; thus, it should be a powerful and appealing conclusion. The ideas presented in the body paragraphs are summarized, through an analysis of the chosen topic question. The main essay ideas are summed up in this section, reminding the reader your topic\'s overarching causes and effects.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You can as well include your own insights into the solutions regarding the topic. This paragraph\'s final sentence should restate the thesis statement, backed by the facts in the body paragraphs. In the conclusion, it is necessary to cover the main idea presented so that your opinions can be tied together by your readers.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Organize Your Essay</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Organize your essay systematically. Include a thesis statement within your outline, showcasing your trend; beginning an essay with an event or phenomenon is a feasible model to adhere.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">A five sentence cause and effects essay sample</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Today, cities have continually emerged to be metropolitans in which approximately half of mankind inhabits.

Moreover, many learning institutions have been set up to educate factory laborers\' children. Better education in metropolitans has encouraged rural communities to invade the City.

Some examples of typical subjects for critical essays include literature, screenplays, films, paintings or sculptures. The critical analysis essay is more than a simple summary of the features or characteristics of the work or your opinion of its value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"margin: 5px auto; display: block;\" title=\"What Is Critical Essay?\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/what-is-critical-essay.jpg\" alt=\"The critical essay is an in-depth objective analysis of the work which exhaustively examines both its positive and negative aspects and bases them on relevant evidence.   \" width=\"649\" height=\"277\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The critical essay is informative in nature and emphasizes the actual work rather than opinion. All observations or claims must be convincingly supported with evidence. For this reason, in writing a critical essay, first person is never used.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Standard essay format of title, introduction, body, and conclusion is followed when writing the critical essay structure, but due to the depth of the analysis, arguments are narrowed and more detailed than a traditional essay.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Structuring the Critical Essay</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Since a critical essay is an examination of a <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Choosing Your Essay Topic\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/picking-your-essay-topic\">specific topic</a></strong>, each point must be supported with solid evidence. The critical essay structure will be more effective if it focuses on a single aspect of a work rather than the work in its entirety. When choosing the title, the specific topic must be revealed in detail.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For instance, rather than providing an overview of the movie \"The Hunger Games\", examine \"The Use of Metaphor in The Hunger Games\". Critical essays narrow a broad topic and allow for depth of analysis. When the topic is too broad, the critical essay structure may tend to extend to too many paragraphs that stray off topic. Strong, concise assertions are always the most effective.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Introduction</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The introduction of a critical essay introduces the topic and includes the specific name of the work being analyzed. At this point, the author or artist should be identified and described. Using relevant background or historical information is an effective method for establishing the importance of your assertions and the purpose of the essay.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Body</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The body is where the writer\'s position is supported by detailed background information. Using factual information to develop the argument and explain the position of the essay will create an effective essay. It is important to evaluate the work and directly follow each assertion with supporting evidence. Critical essays rely on evidence such as historical examples, statistics and comparisons to present as convincing and authoritative. The opinions of others may be used to strengthen the position of the essay but should not be relied on exclusively.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Paragraphs should be used for each individual point made and should transition cleanly and logically to the following paragraph.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The conclusion of concisely restates the position and summarizes how the provided evidence supports the assertion. Remember to restate the title and author of the work in the conclusion as well as the specific purpose of the essay.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Researching Supporting Sources</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Since the critical analysis essay is supported by and based upon authoritative and expert evidence, researching the topic can present a challenge. Follow these research suggestions and the essay will a success:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 5px auto 5px auto;\" title=\"Critical Essay Writing Suggestions\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/critical-essay-writing4.jpg\" alt=\"Follow these research suggestions and the essay will a success: 1) Visit the library for books or magazines on specific to the topic 2) Utilize an online database or consortium 3) Contact an expert in the field and conduct an interview 4) Contact a specialized club or group that focuses on the topic 5) Research current news stories that address the topic\" width=\"649\" height=\"312\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Express your critical analysis essay with confidence and properly cite supporting sources for an effective essay.

But we all know that nothing of quality can be at rock bottom prices.

Then don&rsquo;t shelve a motion and read the article on research report to write a brilliant one. Keep in mind that research reports writing will define your final grade.</p>\r\n<h2>What Is a Research Report Definition?</h2>\r\n<p><strong>A research report is a research document that incorporates the principal aspects of the research work.</strong> We can also define a research report as the systematic, and orderly presentation of the research project in a written form.</p>\r\n<p>In other words, a research report, or report research, is<em> a product of thorough reading of two pieces of literature on a certain topic</em>. Research reports involve relevant information on the research work carried out, as the objectives of research report are always the objectives of the research paper itself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>NOTA BENE</strong></em></p>\r\n<p><em>There are three notions students usually confuse: research paper, research proposal, and research report. It&rsquo;s high time to dot the </em>i&rsquo;s<em> and cross the </em>t&rsquo;s<em> and never mix these notions up again.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>A research paper</strong> (NOT a report research paper) is a research project itself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>A research proposal</strong> (NOT a research report proposal or research proposal report) is the beginning of the research.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A research report</strong> is a culmination and the end of the research.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Research Report Structure</h2>\r\n<p>Be it a case study research report or industry market research reports they all have the similar structure:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Title page</li>\r\n<li>Table of contents</li>\r\n<li>Executive summary</li>\r\n<li>Introduction&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Purpose</li>\r\n<li>Background</li>\r\n<li>Methodology&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Scope</li>\r\n<li>Results/Findings&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Discussion&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Conclusion</li>\r\n<li>Recommendations</li>\r\n<li>Appendix</li>\r\n<li>References</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Writing a good research report is a piece of cake for students if they stick to a research report paper format. <strong>Research report format is the most reasonable arrangement of information to make a desirable impression.</strong> A report should be composed systematically and bound carefully. It&rsquo;s required to use the format (often called structure) that will best fit the requirements and needs of the readers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Writing a good report is easy if you have a research report example before your eyes. A sample paper will help better understand the structure, format, and the general idea of report writing. An example of research paper report can be found on our website.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also helpful for students to look through a research report template before composing their own one. It shows a step-by-step guideline of the report writing process. The introductory paragraph should introduce the topic of the research. Each of the body paragraphs should introduce a certain subtopic and give facts, evidence, and examples. In the concluding paragraph students demonstrate what they have learnt.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Writing research report is usually carried out in 5 steps:</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Getting Ready (Here we define stating the purpose of the research and identifying the audience).</li>\r\n<li>Collecting information (We collect information by reading or researching, then we organize it in a logical order).</li>\r\n<li>Planning (We think out the detailed plan).</li>\r\n<li>Writing process (Drafting, Editing, Writing).</li>\r\n<li>Proofreading.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Research report writing is an important and inevitable assignment in the process of getting an academic degree.

All three have the same meaning. Research report template, research report format and layout of the research report mean the content a research report consists of, the whole structure and its parts. Each part of the investigation report contains particular information written according to the rules of academic report writing. And every student who starts writing a research report should adhere to the guidelines of a research report writing format.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When speaking about the layout of the research report we must say that this term is more general than the research report template. It divides the text of the report into several parts and the contents looks like the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Preliminary Page that consists of topic title and date followed by the Preface or Foreword to investigation. Then goes the table of contents along with illustrations, lists of tables, etc.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Main Text is an outline of the report including all details. Each part of the paper must begin on a new page.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>End Matter contains appendices, bibliography, index.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>How to Write a Research Report Format?</h2>\r\n<p>Research report format depends on its type. To format research report properly follow the steps provided in the corresponding guideline. When writing your paper take into account the following things:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Scope and type</li>\r\n<li>The required formatting style: APA, MLA, Chicago, Harvard, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Outline</li>\r\n<li>Bibliography and footnotes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Aside of college research reports, there are many kinds of research reports students must know so that they don&rsquo;t to confuse their meanings and significance. Let&rsquo;s see what the most popular reports are that people search over the Internet. We&rsquo;ve found three types that appeared to be of high demand. These are equity, market, and scientific research reports. Below is a brief overview of each type.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>What Is an Equity Research Report? Equity Research Report Template</h2>\r\n<blockquote>An equity research report provides data sufficient to make an investment decision i.e. it tells the readers whether they should or should not invest in a particular venture.&nbsp;</blockquote>\r\n<p>Usually, equity research report template is available in investment banks.

After reading your essay your reader should have a vivid and clear picture of the portrayed object, and the more colorful the image is, the better you have managed to reach your readers&rsquo; minds and the better you have mastered descriptive essay writing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto;\" title=\"Descriptive Essay Definition\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/descriptive-essay-definition.png\" alt=\"In your descriptive essay you may depict a place, person, a piece of music, some architecture or anything that is significant to you and will be interesting to your reader\" width=\"750\" height=\"257\" /></p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Learn: <a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/how-to-write-a-descriptive-essay\">How to Write a Descriptive Essay</a></h4>\r\n<h4>Choose a topic for your descriptive essay: <a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-essay/descriptive-essay/topics-and-ideas\">50 Inspiring Descriptive Essay Topics</a></h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you feel unsure how to write your descriptive essay, you can always&nbsp;ask for professional assistance&nbsp;from our writers.

Once you are ready, feel free to request assistance via chat, phone or email.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Purpose of the Descriptive Essay</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As any other essay types, descriptive essay writing is meant to, first of all, facilitate your writing and critical thinking skills. However, with descriptive essay writing this isn&rsquo;t just the case: you need to observe the object, note what makes it unique, different, notable; if you are writing about a piece of music you will need to speak about things like melody, beat, rhythm, lyrics, tempo, harmony, general message etc. All these tasks require a lot of observation skills, ability to observe, notice, analyze and then verbalize one&rsquo;s feelings and put them on paper. Summing up, a descriptive essay is a piece of writing that bridges your sensory perception with your writing skills.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Descriptive Essay Structure</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Descriptive Essays are no different in terms of structure than regular Five Paragraph Essays. This means that they should consist of the introductory paragraph, two to three body paragraphs and the concluding paragraph. The introduction should contain the main essay idea and serve as an attention getter to the reader. Body paragraphs break the main idea into smaller subtopics and dwell on them in greater detail. Each body paragraph should consist of about 6-7 sentences. The final part of any essay is the conclusion. Typically it echoes ideas presented in the introduction and brings them to a logical ending. If your essay is required to be different structurally, stick to the instructions from your school. If, however, you need to write a classical descriptive essay, please refer to <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"How to Structure Your Essay\" href=\"../../essay-structure\">this article</a>.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Tips on Descriptive Essay Writing</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When creating a description essay writers typically use two approaches:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><img style=\"display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto;\" title=\"Approaches to a Descriptive Essay Writing\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/descriptive-essay-types.png\" alt=\"Typically there are two approaches used in the descriptive essay writing: objective and subjective\" width=\"750\" height=\"333\" /></strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Objective Description</strong> &ndash; used to describe physical objects, technical things or present reporting. It is a direct, real to life description of something. The author is providing the reader with facts. Objective description lacks emotions and feelings. It does not give the reader an idea of writer&rsquo;s attitude to the object (just like in an informative essay).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Subjective</strong> (impressionistic) &ndash; is the opposite of the objective approach. The reader will see the picture with your eyes and share the feelings and emotions that the described object evokes in the author.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Unlike objective description, this approach employs all the senses to convey the desirable meaning and achieve the necessary effect. You will share your view and attitude towards the presented subject (much like in a <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"How to Write a Personal Essay?\" href=\"../../personal-experience-essay\">personal essay</a>). This type of description tends to be very sensual, emotional and thoughtful.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">How to Write Descriptive Essays on Paintings</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Describing paintings, pieces of music and architecture are the most typical assignments students get. In order to ease up the writing process, we suggest that whenever a&nbsp;painting is described, the description could take a specific pattern:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li>What is the title of the painting?</li>\r\n<li>Who is the author?</li>\r\n<li>When was this painting created? What historical context has it been placed in? (e.g. revolution, personal conflict, marriage, travel etc.) What inspired the artist to create it?</li>\r\n<li>What art movement and epoch does it belong to? (e.g. impressionism, modernism, classicism, purism, cubism etc.)</li>\r\n<li>Is the painting figurative or abstract? Describe what you see or how the picture makes you feel.</li>\r\n<li>Describe material the artist used to create the picture (oil, coal, pencil, watercolor etc).</li>\r\n<li>Describe form, lines, shapes, colors, values, and textures.</li>\r\n<li>Speak of proportions, balance, emphasis, rhythm, and pattern. Describe how the artist used these elements to attain a certain artistic effect.</li>\r\n<li>Describe what is happening in the picture.</li>\r\n<li>State what you think of the painting. Do you like or dislike it?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We recommend that you write down responses on a separate sheet of paper and then organize them in a <strong>full-scale essay</strong> according to the pattern mentioned above. In wording your responses, you might need to use some art-specific words (see Table 1):</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Table 1.

This information serves as instruction as to how to write an English essay. Using a guideline, like the traditional five-paragraph English essay structure, is a great start and allows for the process of English essay writing to be less daunting. By following the four main steps to English essay writing, the final product will be concise, convincing and informative.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Rough Draft</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sometimes described as \"laying down the bones,\" the initial step in the English essay structure does not involve much actual writing. This is the opportunity to identify the focus and define the purpose of the essay. Many essays address similar topics, so attempt to identify an original approach to the topic. First, become an expert on the topic through research, then decide whether the goal is to inform the readers, to persuade them into action or to narrate a story. Write down every idea at this point and let them flow.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Crafting the Introduction</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Beginning the paper with an interesting anecdote, statistic or quotation is the best way to grab the reader\'s attention. Continue with the thesis and a summation of the essay\'s three main points. The thesis is the overarching idea that you are communicating to the readers, stated in one concise sentence. It typically expresses an idea that is new and interesting to the audience. For example, \"summer weather heats up\" isn\'t a great thesis, since not many would dispute it and it seems like common knowledge, while \"summer weather is heating up more with each passing year\" is both fresh and arguable. Avoid phrases like, \"I\'m going to tell you&hellip;\" or \"This essay is about&hellip;.\" English essay writing is most effective when done in third person.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Creating the Body and Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Body paragraphs for each main point follow the introduction. It is customary to begin with the second strongest argument. The point should be stated in the first or second sentence and immediately followed with supporting details and evidence. Refer back to the stated topic to ensure that the content is not off-topic. Avoid \"I believe\" or \"I think\" opinion statements and create confident sentences. Conclude with your strongest point for impact and so that it sticks with readers. In the conclusion, restate the thesis and summarize without repeating it exactly. Wrap up with a powerful quotation or call to action that encourages your reader to be inspired and act.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Time to Edit</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Let the paper rest for a while before you begin editing if you have the time. Editing is the polishing of a rough draft by checking the English essay structure and general flow of the sentences. Consider the word choices made and the transitions between paragraphs and ideas. Read the essay aloud to evaluate sentence length and flow. Remove words used only to impress. Each word should have a specific value. Check for smooth transitions from one idea to another.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Proofreading Made Easy</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When editing is complete, it is time for a detailed check for spelling, grammar, capitalization and punctuation errors. Never rely on the spell-check tool in your word-processing program, as they do not evaluate context. The best way to check spelling is to read the essay backwards from the last word to the first word. By following this tip, your eyes review what is written, rather than what is expected. Choose a clear 12-point font that is easy to read and has clean lines, like Arial.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many students wonder how to write an English essay.

You need to be able to describe the content of the writing through key literature terms such as irony, satire, character, metaphor, epithet etc.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In order to evaluate the literature, you need to use what is termed as &ldquo;close reading.&rdquo; This suggests that you should be reading with the intension of identifying different levels of meanings within the text.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In getting prepared to write your English literature essay, you need to plan the essay and its structure.

Don\'t leave it or procrastinate until the very last minute; get started as soon as possible.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Determine the question and evaluate the task.</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ensure that you understand precisely what the question demands you to do.</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Identify the crucial words (like analyzing or discuss) and make clear the approach you\'re required to take.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Write an initial essay plan</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Your beginning stage for an essay is the initial reaction to the question or topic. This reaction is based upon what you presently know. Even so, this is only the beginning point. After this, you need to research, query your response and discover some answers.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Researching your argumentative essay topics</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">An attribute of many persuasive essay papers is that it relies on the work of other researchers and writers. Therefore, researching and reading are keys to essay writing. By researching you will get the evidence and knowledge which will enable you to address the essay question</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Organizing Your Ideas</h2>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Start organizing your ideas and research into an answer.</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">After you have investigated and your thoughts are more developed, generate a subsequent essay plan. It\'ll help you figure out how to address the question/topic and how the paper will be organized. Determine a possible answer to the topic/question (with regards to the research you\'ve done).</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Decide on the evidence/information you\'ll use to address the question</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Take a look at your notes and select examples to offer evidence in supporting your answer</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Choose which points you\'ll discuss, and their order</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Thinking it through</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Essay writing demands both critical and creative thinking.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Creative thinking motivates you to expand your ideas. Consider techniques like mind mapping or brainstorming.</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Critical thinking stimulates you to filter the scope or focus of your ideas (for instance, asking why a case in point is vital to your argument).</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your essay ought to be balanced: which is, it should contain an array of information and opinions from several authors that examine the pertinent aspects and key arguments and of a specific topic.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Writing your essay paper</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Your initial draft is not going to be your final piece; visualize it as a raw material you\'ll refine through re-drafting and editing. Once you have a draft, you may work on crafting well.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Structuring the essay</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Structuring your paper in the most powerful way to convey your ideas/points and address the question is also important.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Essay paragraph</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Each section of your research paper should contain:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A topic sentence</strong> which states the controlling or central idea</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Supporting sentences</strong> to develop and explain the point you`re making</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Evidence.</strong> Your main point must be supported by pertinent evidence from your readings.</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Analysis.</strong> Never leave the facts hanging there - interpret and analyze it! Touch upon the implication/impact/significance and sign off the last part with a critical summary you\'ve pulled from the evidence.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Referencing</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">All academic essays should have references. Referencing protects against plagiarism, a severe academic offense. Ensure that you are acquainted with the referencing styles your school or faculty requires.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Editing and proofreading</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The last thing you must do is to edit and proofread your <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Persuasive Essay Topics\" href=\"../../how-to-write-a-persuasive-essay\">persuasive essay topics</a></strong> to ensure there is no spelling, grammar issues and to fine-tune your essay.

As the writer would need to carefully examine both sides of an issue to formulate a thesis or main idea, to write an effective expository essay, this particular format is heavily utilized for tests and exams. When writing an expository essay, the student may use an analytical approach, contrast and compare technique, or use cause and effect to give weight to an idea.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As with most types of essays, the expository essay structure should follow a general guideline. The following steps illustrate how an expository essay should be outlined:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A strong thesis statement that tells the reader about the main idea of the essay.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Several paragraphs that form the body of the essay and include information that substantiates, or supports, the main idea stated in the thesis.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A solid conclusion that takes the supporting information used throughout the essay, sums it all up and ends by reinforcing the thesis statement.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">While it is important to follow the general outline for a well-structured expository essay, it is also important to pay attention to certain details. When writing the body of the essay, the writer should be aware of how transitions are used between paragraphs. Transitions could be considered the connective thread of the expository essay, words and grammatical phrases that pull the essay together. Transitional phrases often include the use of adverbs or an opening sentence that ties into the concluding statement of the previous paragraph.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Writing an expository essay isn\'t all about following the rules, however! A writer also has a lot of latitudes to be very creative during the writing process, too. Yes, expository essays are based on supporting facts and composing an effective essay is, in itself, a bit technical. Yet, the writer can infuse the essay with their individual voice with wording. This can be tricky because going too far with the creativity carries the risk of distracting the reader from the main point of what the expositor essay writer is trying to convey.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When writing the conclusion of an expository essay, the writer has the best chance of leaving the strongest impression on the reader. Many students utilize a strategy that sums up the entire essay by composing sentences that readdress the points made in the body of the essay. This can be an effective strategy when the wording is concise and compelling.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once students began to understand the basics of how to write an expository essay, they gain an invaluable tool for creating effective arguments, a beneficial attribute that can last a lifetime. Expository essays are a wonderful way to learn how to introduce a powerful idea, explain why it matters, and convincing the world that your perspective does, in fact, matter.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Are you a student or writer that has need of an expository essay?

If your assignment doesn&rsquo;t tell you specifically how to write an essay you need to come up with, it is implied that you are expected to write a 5 paragraph essay. This staple essay is most often found in high-school and junior college years, and as an academic complexity of studies goes up, essay <a title=\"Assignment Writing Help \" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/assignment-writing-help\">writing assignments</a> get more sophisticated too.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why are five paragraph essays important?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It has been conventionally agreed that a five paragraph essay is a basic essay format. Its <a href=\"../../five-paragraph-essay/outline\">simple structure</a> allows students to practice effective and organized writing by following an invariant logical pattern, which eventually results in increased ability to explain a problem or a phenomenon. The ability to write logically following a set essay format will on later stages evolve in clear and logical research and academic writing. Therefore the skills for writing a five-paragraph essay are essential for your academic success.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;Our writers guarantee the premium quality content, complete reference, and zero plagiarism.&nbsp;<a title=\"Place an Order\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">Place your order here</a>&nbsp;and enjoy the result!</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">What is the basic essay structure?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Generally speaking, five paragraph essays have a fixed structure. As its name suggests, a five-paragraph essay&nbsp;will contain five logical sections: introduction, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The introduction is always the opening paragraph in your essay and you will need to include such elements as the thesis statement and the three sub-topics which are called &lsquo;body&rsquo; paragraphs. The last paragraph is the conclusion and you will have to sum up the ideas expressed in previous paragraphs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/ozessay-five-paragraph-essay-structure-hamburger.jpg\" alt=\"Here the most basic scheme of a five paragraph essay: it\'s often likened to a hamburger and consists of an introduction, several body paragraphs and a conlcusion\" width=\"850\" height=\"473\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A good introduction has the ultimate power in either grabbing the readers&rsquo; attention or losing it. With thousands of essays out there, your reader will make a reading decision by reading the first couple of sentences and skimming through the body of the paper. Consequently, writing a good, eye-catching introduction is of ultimate importance to an effective composition.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Tips for writing an effective essay introduction</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Make a general statement and then narrow it down</em>. Generally, the way of starting an essay is the least interesting for the reader; however, it&rsquo;s a proven technique that is effective. This would be the most appropriate beginning for most academic essays that do not allow starting an essay otherwise.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Use a quote that is relevant to the topic.</em> This is generally a good and a powerful beginning for an essay that is written during high school and early college years. A quote from someone who is respected in a society will add weight to your paper and will provoke readers&rsquo; interest in the paper. However, you should bear in mind that subsequent text needs to be straight to the point and support the initial claim.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Use a rhetoric question.</em> A rhetoric question is, in essence, a disguised statement that requires no response; however, it will set your reader wondering about an issue. All you need to do is elaborate on the topic and provide convincing examples. Initial readers&rsquo; interest won&rsquo;t last long if the text that follows doesn&rsquo;t support the initial claim. Again, this type of starting your essay is not universally acceptable, and you will need to take into account the kind of essay you are working on and its purpose.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Start with an example:</em> use statistics or another example relevant to the topic. This is the opposite of the technique that&rsquo;s been mentioned first - in this case, you go from the specific to the general. Provide an example and try to establish a general pattern based on that example. Ideally, you would need several such examples to make a generalization, otherwise, you can make a false conclusion (this is called a sample, generally the more examples you have, the better the sampling, and the more accurate is the conclusion.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"Essay Structure\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-structure\">How to Structure Your Essay</a></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"Essay Topics \" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-topic\">Best Essay Topics</a></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"College Essay Writing \" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/college-essay/writing\">College Essay Writing</a></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/argumentative-essay-writing-service\">Argumentative Essay Writing Service</a></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-structure\">Essay Structure</a>&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The list of good and catchy ways of introducing your thoughts in an essay isn&rsquo;t limited to the ones mentioned above. You can you any of them or any combination thereof &ndash; anything that is interesting to the reader will work. Remember that your goal is to catch your reader&rsquo;s attention and retain it during the next several paragraphs, which will convey the main points to your reader. Once you have started with a strong introduction, it is high time to write the body paragraphs themselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Writing body paragraphs can be quite a straightforward process if one bears in mind their basic structure. Most writing experts suggest that a typical body paragraph should take the following format:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Topic sentence.</strong> This is the first sentence that introduces the main idea of the paragraph. This idea is going to be further elaborated within the same paragraph.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Details or examples supporting the idea from the topic sentence.</strong> The topic sentence should be supported with some piece of evidence that would get your essay more &lsquo;weight&rsquo; and will sound more convincing. In a case of an academic paper, you will need to mention the source of the information.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Comments/Analysis.</strong> Add two or more sentences with a commentary of the idea expressed in your main essay. If this is an essay that requires your evaluation, this can be your thoughts, ideas, impressions, judgments etc. If this is an academic essay, you will need to base your judgment on previous research to gain credibility.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Conclusion.</strong> Paragraph conclusion recaps the main paragraph idea. It also serves the purpose of connecting the previous paragraph with the next one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Essay conclusion should be the logical finale of your writing. Once you are done writing your body paragraphs, look at the ideas expressed in the introduction and body paragraphs, you will need to restate each of them individually and then relate to the thesis statement. In this part of your essay, you will need to pay special attention to the initial requirement and see if it needs you to summarize your key elements or analyze them. Whenever you are required to do an analytical part, you are expected to dig in a bit deeper, not just merely restate the items mentioned previously.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Whatever the case, OZessay will be glad to assist you with any of the essay types, we will be happy to assist.

Law essays differ from the conventional essays that undergraduate students have been required to write; consequently, know how to write these essays and knowing the differences is an advantage. The depth of analysis of the topic and level of required research is the primary difference between a legal essay and other academic papers. Background research and extensive knowledge of the topic are required in order to develop convincing legal arguments. The art of legal writing consists of the ability to write only what is necessary for as few words as possible and omitting anything that is not relevant.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>\"<em>How to write a law essay?</em>\" you may ask. No worries - we are here to help.</strong></p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Context Is the King</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In traditional education, students are taught to begin outlining the main points in the first sentence of your essay, but when drafting a law essay, context is imperative. It is recommended that in a law essay, the paper begins with some legal background that provides a foundation for the arguments that will follow. Open your paper with one to three sentences of background information that provides context for the argument that follows. One example is:</p>\r\n<blockquote><em>The Supreme Court reviewed specific application of capital punishment in the 1940s and 1950s and in each reviewed case, the issue of constitutionality of the death penalty was not addressed.</em></blockquote>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Follow the Essay Format</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Essays are typically structured in a five paragraph format beginning with the introduction, following with two to three convincing paragraphs and closing with a conclusion to wrap it up.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"margin: 5px auto; display: block;\" title=\"Law Essay Structure\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/law-essay-structure.jpg\" alt=\"In introduction, you should provide background research, introduce main arguments, refer back to the question and lead in to the body of the essay. In the body, you must identify 2 or 3 main points and structure them into paragraphs, be concise, introduce primary and secondary sources and connect paragraphs to create logical flow. In the conclusion, you should sum up arguments, refer back to original question, provide closing context and remember the question. \" width=\"650\" height=\"932\" /></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">After proving the necessary background information in your introduction, it is important to directly relate the references back to the specific question being addressed. Clearly, refer to the question in the introduction portion of the essay by utilizing key terms throughout the essay to tie the arguments together. For example, if the question is: \"Does [...] bill fundamentally violate the [&hellip;] amendment?\" the essay should refer back in the following way:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>This essay will analyze the [...] bill and examine the various ways that it violates the [...] amendment.</em></p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Consider the Audience</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Identify the audience of the essay prior to outlining your arguments. If your legal essay is an assignment that is meant to establish a knowledge of legal jargon and terminology learned in class, utilizing such language and terminology is appropriate. However, if the legal essay is directed towards the general public or a special interest group, legal terms are not recommended. For essays directed towards those not within the legal community, plain language is preferred and will more clearly define your arguments.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Legal essays may be written at different levels of complexity and some may require additional paragraphs for extensive arguments and supporting information. Law essays are not opinions, so writing in clear confident sentences and providing sufficient support will ensure that your essay is top notch.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you are looking for help with legal essay writing, you\'ve come to the right place.

For example, &lsquo;how I spent my summer&rsquo; would be a personal essay as it tells the reader a story of <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"../../personal-experience-essay\">your experience</a></strong> during the summer period.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Function of Personal Experience Essay</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Personal essays are used predominantly to develop one&rsquo;s <strong>narrative skills</strong>. This kind of essay doesn&rsquo;t expect you to go deep into analysis &ndash; merely tell your reader what you saw, heard or lived through. Another subtype of personal essays is the one that requires you to view your experience in retrospective and analyze them. This type of essays is generally known as the <strong>reflection essay</strong>. The purpose of the reflection essay is to analyze how a certain event or a series of events impacted your life and contributed to your personal development. When you apply for university admission, you will be expected to write such a personal essay for the admission committee. The personal essay should demonstrate your dedication and commitment to the chosen field of study and where you have drawn your inspirations to pursue the chosen profession. An effective personal essay will combine both professional and personal aspects of the applicant&rsquo;s life. The crucial aspect in reflection essay writing is the introspection rather than the retrospection, i.e. you don&rsquo;t just look back and describe past events, but rather analyze those events and try to determine their impact on your personality, character etc.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">How to Format Your Personal Essay</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A personal essay in its basic form should take follows the prescribed five paragraph format, comprising the introduction, two-three body paragraphs, and the conclusion.

Personal essays that are written retrospectively are generally easy to write.&nbsp; First of all, you are free to sound personal and use personal pronouns in your paper, so don&rsquo;t worry &ndash; the I&rsquo;s and we&rsquo;s in your paper will be absolutely ok, unlike in most other essay types. Remember that if <em>you are narrating your experiences</em>, your story needs to be lined out and logical. Avoid jumping from one event to another without making a link between the two. Try to sound natural and show your reader who you really are. Using &lsquo;fluffy&rsquo; language, being overtly witty/humorous when you are not, and especially making up events that never happened in reality are your personal essay killers. Finally, when working on your essay, make sure you proofread the paper to rid it of grammar and spelling errors.

For example, &lsquo;how I spent my summer&rsquo; would be a personal essay as it tells the reader a story of your experience during the summer period.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Function of Personal Experience Essay</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Personal essays are used predominantly to develop one&rsquo;s <strong>narrative skills</strong>. This kind of essay doesn&rsquo;t expect you to go deep into analysis &ndash; merely tell your reader what you saw, heard or lived through. Another subtype of personal essays is the one that requires you to view your experience in retrospective and analyze them. This type of essays is generally known as the <strong>reflection essay</strong>. The purpose of the <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"../../reflective-essay\">reflection essay</a></strong> is to analyze how a certain event or a series of events impacted your life and contributed to your personal development. When you apply for university admission, you will be expected to write such a personal essay for the admission committee. The personal essay should demonstrate your dedication and commitment to the chosen field of study and where you have drawn your inspirations to pursue the chosen profession. An effective personal essay will combine both professional and personal aspects of the applicant&rsquo;s life. The crucial aspect in reflection essay writing is the introspection rather than the retrospection, i.e. you don&rsquo;t just look back and describe past events, but rather analyze those events and try to determine their impact on your personality, character etc.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Personal Essay Format</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A personal essay in its basic form should take follows the prescribed five paragraph format, comprising the introduction, two-three body paragraphs, and the conclusion.

They usually confuse it with a literary essay or a research paper. Others think that they are supposed to solely research and state the opinions of those scholars who hold various beliefs on a given topic. However, these are not the right approaches to consider for such a paper. You are expected to come up with a clear thesis and defend it extensively based on your individual assessment on the issue as well as other scholar\'s opinions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">First, introduce the paper with a strong and clear thesis statement that explains the problem. This is because clarity is a fundamental ingredient of a quality philosophy essay. Also, state the way in which you are going to deal with this issue.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Secondly, a few words on the structure of the philosophy essay. You should go on to the body of the essay whereby you should make your stand on the matter clear and then rationalize and support it using persuasive and substantial arguments. You should also back your view with logical explanations and relevant data. The body should also contain other people\'s opinion on the issue; both the ones that support your position and those that oppose it. You should do an in-depth analysis of their strong and weak arguments and explain how your point of view holds water as compared to those of others. You may also anticipate objections to your stand on the issue and respond to them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is crucial to choose your words properly and wisely to avoid making your essay vague and misleading. You should also desist from using difficult words in an effort to impress the lecturer. Instead, look for words that are suitable and concise. This way, you will avoid passing the wrong messages and leaving the reader of your essay confused and unsure about your point of view.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You may include quotes in your philosophy paper as well. However, always ensure that the quotes support or contradict the point that you are trying to put across. The quotes should be relevant and analyzed extensively. You should also ensure that the content of the quote has a direct link to the basis of your argument.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Lastly, you should write a solid conclusion. It should consist of your final view on the issue in question. It should reflect on the analysis you have discussed in the body of the essay. This way, the reader will be in a position to predict your opinion. Alternatively, you may choose to go against the grain and make an unexpected conclusion. Regardless of your opinion, it should have a strong connection to the position that you have been strongly advocating for on the issue. Keep in mind that the evaluator will be assessing the degree to which you have grasped the issue and how well you have argued your points. Your grade will depend on the depth and quality of the paper. Therefore, you will not achieve a standard philosophy essay through writing a sub-standard analysis.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once you have finished writing the paper, you should proofread it to ensure that there are no grammatical errors or incomprehensible statements. You should also add examples where you feel it is necessary since philosophy thrives on definitions and examples. This is because they make the essay more persuasive. Also, check to see that the essay has a good flow and that you have communicated exactly what you wanted to say on the issue.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We have written hundreds of philosophy essays for our customers and are ready to provide assistance if you need it.

Nevertheless, students who first come to work on such assignments often end up in a dead end, not knowing where to start or how to write a reflective essay at all. This article attempts to explain some basic notions of reflective essay writing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Reflective Essay Definition\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/reflective-essay-definition.png\" alt=\"What is a reflective essay?

Essentially, writing reflective essays is all based on reflection and self-reflection: human&rsquo;s capacity to exercise introspection and willingness to explore one&rsquo;s inner thoughts and/or experiences.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n<li><a href=\"../../reflective-essay/how-to-write\">How to Write a Reflective Essay</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"../../essay-structure\">Essay Structure</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"../../example-of-a-five-paragraph-essay\">Example of a Five Paragraph Essay</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Why is Reflective Essay Writing Important?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Reflective essay writing can be a very challenging task. The impact of such essay writing is multifaceted: starting from the obvious essay skills enhancement to the more complicated transference of self-reflection skills into real life. If taken outside the academic setting, the ability to self-reflect and find the root-cause of a given event is of great help to just about any individual.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For example, you&rsquo;ve made a mistake somewhere along the path. When you try to sit down and reflect on it, the reasons and root causes of such event become obvious to you. This, in turn, will allow you to avoid making similar mistakes in future. This is the power of analysis and self-reflection outside just the classroom setting.</p>\r\n<h3>Reflective Essay Outline Format</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">From the point of view of essay structure, any <a title=\"Reflective Essay Free Example\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-essay/reflective-essay/free-example\">reflective essay</a> is still a typical essay, requiring anyone working on it to maintain the basic essay format: introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Reflective Essay Outline Format\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/reflective_essay-outline-format.png\" alt=\"Reflective Essay Outline Format includes introduction, body and conclusion. \" width=\"650\" height=\"139\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The introduction</strong> should be the part of the essay that grabs a reader\'s attention to make them interested in the rest of the story. It should include your thesis statement and some general background information about the topic. It&rsquo;s here that you present your basic essay idea which is then elaborated in the body paragraphs. The introductory part of your essay (any essay, not just reflective one) serves the eye-catching purpose: if the reader finds your essay boring after the first couple of sentences, your paper won&rsquo;t be read any further. Academic essays, however, are different: your professors will definitely read them till the end, however, if they find them irrelevant or not to the point, your final grade will go down.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The body</strong> is the next part of the essay and provides the story itself. Body paragraphs should enumerate your main ideas and provide from three to five supporting sentences. The body is arranged to make the story flow while containing the essay\'s important points. &nbsp;The description provided in the body should be brief enough to portray the picture and long enough to make the story interesting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Ultimately, <strong>the conclusion</strong> should summarize the main ideas expressed in your paper and finalize it. It contains the lesson learned from the writer\'s reflection. The conclusion of the reflection essay should address:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Whether you achieve your aims<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What would you like to change if you were to repeat the process<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What were the key learning outcomes<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Will and how would you apply the gained knowledge in future work <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How will you propose to make improvements</p>\r\n<h3>Reflective Essay Graphic Organizer</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A graphic organizer is an essential visual aid that helps a writer accurately plan his/her essay. Most reflective essays comprise of an incident, the response and the reflection. The three parts when graphically displayed portray a clearer picture where the writer can easily see how everything fits into the big picture which is the essay.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A graphic organizer is a great tool that assists a writer to get a better understanding of how to move from one part to another of her recollection. An organizer saves time since once does not have to go back to correct mistakes which will have been eradicated by the planning process.</p>\r\n<h3>Reflective Essay Writing Tips</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>TIP 1.</strong> An author should not seek to include all of his experiences in a single essay. A reflective essay should contain a single event that holds the most valuable lesson or has had the biggest impact on your life.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>TIP 2.</strong> Honesty is the best policy when it comes to writing reflective essays. The essay should not be exaggerated to the point where a reader can tell it is unreal.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>TIP 3.</strong> A reflective essay writer should ensure there are no contradicting elements in his story. Moreover, the article should be the author\'s experience and no other\'s.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>TIP 4.</strong> A student may decide to order a reflective essay from an essay writing service. The reasoning behind the above decision may be that professional writers would be a lot better at telling stories than the student which would make the essay more attractive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As such a reflection essay is usually undertaken at the graduate level, you are expected to carry out your reflections professionally, and objectively and write your reflective essay using appropriate vocabulary, and in suitable writing style.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you want to entrust the writing process to professionals, we are ready to help you&nbsp;<a title=\"Writing Help\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">write your essay effectively</a>.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Reflective Essay Writing Tips\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/reflective-essay-writing-tips.png\" alt=\"What are reflective essay writing tips?

The next step is selecting a writing professional who can handle the job.

This step is meant to ensure uncompromised paper quality and ensure the customer gets a paper he/she wants. Next, the writing routine begins. You, as the customer, are expected to communicate with your writer and staff, and let them know immediately when you think some additional action is needed. If such a need arises, please alert <strong style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva;\">our staff</strong> immediately and they will take care of the situation for you.

It is always done at the end of the writing process as the last step before you submit your document or text to be published.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You may be a good writer, but detecting faults may not be your strength. This is typically the case when it comes to checking your own writing. However, certain individuals have outstanding proofreading skills; it is such individuals that we employ as our editors and proofreaders. Our proofreaders are 100% competent with grammar, excellent at detecting punctuation mistakes, and will notice common spelling mistakes and syntax errors that the electronic spell checkers fail to detect. If you have an important academic paper or an essay to submit, make sure it is properly proofread. We guarantee that after your paper has been proofread by our editors, it will climb a few quality notches and be far from mediocre writing.&nbsp;<strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Place an Order\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">Get your essays and term papers proofread by a professional proofreading service!</a></strong></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Difference Between Editing and Proofreading</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many people think that editing and proofreading are one and the same, but they are not! Editing and proofreading are two distinct words in the publishing process. Every document or text needs both editor and proofreader. All publishing houses have both, and sometimes put a written piece through various editing levels before it ever hits the proofreading stage. So, how do these two terms differ?</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Editing vs. Proofreading\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/editing-versus-proofreading.jpg\" alt=\"Editing involves a detailed content review for the transition between paragraphs and ensures that your evidence really backs up your argument. Proofreading, on the other hand, focuses on correcting surface errors in writing such as spelling, grammar, punctuation and other language mistakes. \" width=\"650\" height=\"373\" /></h3>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Editing</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Editing is about making suggestions and revisions about the text or document, focusing on improving the flow, accuracy of the language and the overall readability as well as checking for spelling and grammar. In other words, it involves a detailed content review for the transition between paragraphs and ensures that your evidence really backs up your argument. When performing an edit, editors are looking for consistency and clarity in your thoughts to ensure that your written content gives the impression that language comes naturally from you, even if it does not. The editors examine the content, structure within paragraphs, clarity, citations, style and overall content structure.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Proofreading</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Proofreading, on the other hand, is the last stage of the editing process. It is, therefore, an affordable service, still, performs a crucial role. It focuses on correcting surface errors in writing such as spelling, grammar, punctuation, and other language mistakes. The proofreading process detects anomalies such as different language sets, faulty assumption about sentence structure, grammar, field-specific terminologies, and embedded information. This means that we must seriously review documents without relying on grammar and spell checks to perform it for us. It provides quality assurance for your content but should be done only after your document or text is edited.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Main Proofreading Strategies</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Proofreading can be a daunting process, especially when you are not sure where to begin or what the process entails. If you are ready to proofread your content, you should do so thoroughly and carefully. Although it is critical to review your work and seek opinions of others, the following proofreading strategies may prove useful:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Leave yourself plenty of time</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">After you have finished editing your content, leave it for 30 minutes, a day or two, or even a week. This will allow you to approach proofreading with fresh mind and eyes.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Prepare a list of what to look for</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Keep the list of errors you always make. The list will help you manage your time and not feel weighed down by proofreading. Get the list of the common errors and mistakes you always make.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Print out a hard copy</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Reading from your computer is not an effective way to proofread. Print a hard copy of your content will help you detect spelling, grammar, style and punctuation errors.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Read aloud</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Reading aloud will enable to detect run-on sentences, organization issues, awkward transitions and other grammatical mistakes that you might not detect while reading silently. You can do it to yourself, do it to your friends or let your friend read your content.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don&rsquo;t rush</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many errors or mistakes in writing happen because we rush. Read carefully and slowly to give your mind and eyes enough time to recognize/spot errors.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Read from the end</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Try to read each sentence one at a time, starting from the end of the paper document, instead of the beginning. This will force you to pay attention to every sentence rather than the whole idea in the paper.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Look for a particular error at a time</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Check a particular error at a time. Identify punctuation, citation, grammar, spelling and other grammatical errors separately. You might get confused or fail to detect some errors when looking for them at one go!</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Purpose of Proofreading</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is a hard fact that computer spell checker cannot catch all mistakes on your text. More specifically, it won&rsquo;t catch inconsistencies, omitted words, spelling errors, punctuations, grammar and other analytics details in your content. So, how will you solve the situation? Of course proofreading!</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Proofreading allows you to include everything you wanted in any piece of writing</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">It helps you remove any little, unnecessary mistakes or errors you may have made</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">It gives you a chance to review your work and include anything you might have missed</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">It can help you get extra marks in your exams that could make the difference in your entire grade</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">It improves the quality of your material, and I&rsquo;m very sure you will earn more compliments</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even in this technological age, there is no substitute for a professional traditional proofreader</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The professionally proofread copy will improve the understanding of your readers and ensure that you are passing the message you wanted to.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">How to Proofread a Paper</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Proofreading is not just about casting a glance over a piece of content you have created; it requires serious concentration to focus on the errors and layout. Unfortunately, errors are difficult to detect, so it is important to read word by word to ensure you miss nothing. Because it involves correcting minor mistakes, it does not require a lot of rewriting. Here is a step by step on how to proofread a paper:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"How to Proofread a Paper\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/oz-proofreading.jpg\" alt=\"To proofread a paper you should Set it aside, Use a checklist, Focus on one sentence at a time, Read aloud, Double check your details, Make corrections, Final check, Publish\" width=\"650\" height=\"1024\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Editors can professionally proofread your document to ensure it is precise, well-written and easy to read. It is critical to carefully proofread all your written materials before making them public. Proofreading is an essential part of your writing process: not just icing on the cake.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Proofreading Tips</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Proofreading your own work can sometimes be a challenging task. This is because you already know the content, have the picture in your mind and, as a result, you tend to skim over words. Besides, you know your own voice, so even if you have errors in your writing, you might not hear or see them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here are some tips on how to proofread:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don&rsquo;t proofread until you are completely finished with writing and editing</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Read it silently and also loudly</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Read it slowly</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Read it backward to focus on spelling errors</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Print it and read it</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Point your figures, while reading one sentence at a time</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don&rsquo;t proofread for all mistakes at once</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Forget the story and read it as a stranger to the content</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Take note of the mistakes and errors</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Get familiar with your common mistakes</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Get someone else to read it for you</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Check format last</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why Is It Better to Find a Service for Proofreading</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Proofreading is something that even the world&rsquo;s greatest writers find difficult to deal with. It requires you to have fine eyes to spot all errors and mistakes in a long piece of work. Proofreading can mean the difference between the grade you absolutely get and the grade you want. So, it is advisable to get a highly qualified team of professional proofreaders who can guarantee you a satisfying final result.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Don&rsquo;t let errors or mistakes tarnish your work, whether it is an essay, research paper, business communication, thesis and any other college assignment - <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Writing Help\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">ask our writers to proofread your paper!</a></strong> Remember, proofreading isn&rsquo;t similar to editing.

To be able to deal with such academic tasks on a day-to-day basis, a team of dedicated professionals is needed; this is exactly what we are looking for when reviewing new applications: not only the applicant needs to be well-qualified, have a respective background and a degree, but he/she must be also committed to everyday high-quality work. Without it, no writing professional will be able to make a career with our company. As the result of such writer selection, only the most experienced and dedicated professionals thrive at the company. In turn, by having the most professional writers as a part of our staff, we are able to maintain the highest quality of writing. Each project is being handled with special care and is duly worked on.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">All writers without exception know that communication with the customer is essential to the overall project success. Only in the process of communication can both parties exchange information that is critical in getting the project done according to the original instructions. In turn, we as a company, facilitate every possibility of customer-staff-writer communication to ensure a win-win-win situation. Every customer has access to the so-called &lsquo;customized control panel&rsquo; that allows him or her to control and direct the writing process. The control panel allows the customer to communicate with the writer and staff whenever such need arises. We encourage <strong>our writers</strong> to stay signed into their respective panels to be able to respond to customers&rsquo; queries as soon as a question is sent. In case the situation gets urgent, the customer can use the same control panel to contact staff and they will follow up with a phone call to make sure all customers&rsquo; queries are handled ASAP. We believe that such mode of operation is critical to the overall project success and it explains why over 75% of customers come back to us again and again.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">While selecting writers we are giving preference to those professionals who are experienced in Marketing, Management, Engineering, Law and IT; these appear to be the most demanded backgrounds in the writing industry. Besides applicants majoring in the above-mentioned disciplines, we are also interested in specialists of other backgrounds because we need to handle all kinds of assignments. Such assignments might not come in very frequently; however, we need to have an appropriate writer for any situation, and we do.

You may be an academic person pressed for time, needing to engage a ghostwriter in carrying out the literature reviews of various theories and models that are required for your research paper. You may also be a celebrity or a sports personality, who wishes to publish an autobiography. You may be a singer or a composer wishing to have someone else&rsquo;s creative input to your work. Regardless of the circumstance, there are writing companies that offer superb ghost writing services to clients with diverse needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are two main streams of ghostwriting: <em>creative</em> and <em>academic/professional work.</em></p>\r\n<h3>Creative Work</h3>\r\n<p><strong>&bull; Autobiographies</strong></p>\r\n<p>Autobiographies are notoriously difficult for the subject to write. But the name autobiography implies that it is written entirely on the subject&mdash;and what better way to live through the exploits of someone like Keith Richards or Slash. Public figures who lack the momentum and skills to write their own autobiography will often hire a ghostwriter (someone to ghostwrite their autobiographies). The ghostwriter lets the author to look&nbsp;at their life from a different angle, prompting with investigative questions, and thus creating a more objective portrayal of events.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&bull; Family History Records</strong></p>\r\n<p>Family history records can take a similar form as autobiographies. Ghostwriters study a family&rsquo;s history without bias for an objective and perspective.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&bull; Fiction Stories</strong></p>\r\n<p>Fiction stories are ghostwritten when a person has a great idea but no idea how to execute it in the form of a story.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&bull; Script and Screenplay</strong></p>\r\n<p>Script and screenplay writing requires a different set of story-telling skills. Ghostwriters are often hired to write for TV shows because of tight turnarounds or to work with an author who does not properly understand stage directions and dialog.</p>\r\n<h3>Academic/Professional Work</h3>\r\n<p><strong>&bull; Business Documents</strong></p>\r\n<p>Business documents can be drawn up by ghostwriters who are hired to take meeting minutes or record the negotiations, courtroom activity, and government meetings.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&bull; Instruction Manuals</strong></p>\r\n<p>Instruction manuals must accompany many products, including electronics, household appliances, tools, and even medications. Ghostwriters are hired for this tedious tasks when they&nbsp;threaten to bog down other employees.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&bull; Blogs</strong></p>\r\n<p>Blogs are like online diaries that sometimes serve a marketing strategy. Bloggers are expected to adopt a constant content flow to keep the audience engaged. Ghostwriters can help by carrying some of the workloads during busy schedules, for example, they may ghostwrite for a fashion blog during New York Fashion Week.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&bull; Medical Documents</strong></p>\r\n<p>Medical documents help researchers and scientists distil their findings into official medical report or journal articles. Ghostwriters help when the researcher or scientist does not possess comprehensive writing skills and then to write the publicity material to get the document noticed by media outlets.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&bull; Speeches</strong></p>\r\n<p>Speeches are often ghostwritten for politicians, celebrities, and corporate executives who need to deliver charismatic and compelling speeches.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&bull; Social Media Accounts</strong></p>\r\n<p>Social media accounts need constant attention to keep them updated and informative. Many public figures and businesses need ghostwriters to create regular content and respond to users instantly.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&bull; Newsletters</strong></p>\r\n<p>Newsletters are sent out at regular intervals by businesses, news outlets, and other institutions. Ghostwriters will cover various events, or create the daily or weekly tips for the document.</p>\r\n<h2>Hiring a Ghostwriter Who Writes Affordable Papers</h2>\r\n<p>Ghostwriting can be an affordable way for an expert with no writing skills to get their expertise out there in a book. The demand is high enough that ghostwriters can make a good living and most ghostwriters have very little overhead. The most affordable ones work independently of expensive agencies who take agency fees. This type of ghostwriter can provide customized service and no extra frills.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-essays\">CUSTOM ESSAY WRITING SERVICE</a></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Professional ghostwriter should be able to provide an accurate estimate of the time and money required for any project. The estimate will take the length of the completed work, the scope of the research, the deadline and the availability of the original author into consideration.</p>\r\n<p>They may require 50% of their fee upfront, based on that estimate. If the substantial time has to be added to the project the ghostwriter will write up a new order to reflect the augmentation.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Good, Affordable Ghostwriters:</strong></h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Prove early on to be reliable and organized.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Take the information you give them and they will work for you through your entire assignment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Will never judge you or criticize you.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Will guide and advise you on the best way to get your story or ideas across to your audience.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Will always be willing to sign contracts to the effect of drawing out the ghost-author relationship, responsibilities and the ownership of the final body of work.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Will be as discreet, almost to the point of doctor-client or lawyer-client privilege.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Will have connections to publishers and agents if it is appropriate to have your assignment published in the future.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Won&rsquo;t be offended if you ask for changes or criticize their work. A very good ghostwriter will be grateful for any guidance you can give them&mdash;constructive criticism over aimless complaining.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Will remain flexible and responsive to your needs at all times, as you must be to theirs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>How Does Ghostwriting Work?</h2>\r\n<p>You may work with a professional writer in one of the several ways. In one scenario, you provide complete direction for the outline, tone, and information and the writer develops your words into a finished piece of writing. In the second scenario, you provide an outline or transcript and the writer does all the research and writing, all you need to do is tweak and approve the final draft. Of course, there is also a very hands-off approach where you leave most of the details up to the writer, perhaps just asking them to stick to a certain citation method or style guide.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Tailored to Your Needs</strong></p>\r\n<p>Custom written papers will be written to meet your specific requirements. The ghostwriter you hire will make sure to provide you with the required citation and referencing style (Harvard, APA, MLA etc.) that meets the requests of the instructor.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Emphasis on Originality</strong></p>\r\n<p>Plagiarism is considered as a serious offense through the academia and a ghostwriter knows how to create 100% original content that will never be flagged for plagiarism.</p>\r\n<p>Prompt delivery is one of the most crucial factors to good coursework. A coursework ghostwriter writing will stick to the tight deadlines to submit your coursework papers on schedule.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Professional Approach</strong></p>\r\n<p>It is recommended to look for only reputable coursework writing services when looking for a convenient and reliable solution to excessive coursework. You should feel at every point of the process that you are in the hands of a proficient writing team that can regularly deliver quality coursework assignments at affordable prices.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Ethical Aspect</strong></p>\r\n<p>Ghostwriting is a common practice and ghostwriters are fiercely loyal when it comes to defending their occupation from those who claim it to be unethical. But in an online world dependent on a constant flow of content, some of the most successful people are in need of ghostwriters to keep pushing the central message out. Even Guy Kawasaki has admitted to using ghostwriters to keep his Twitter account flush with new posts.</p>\r\n<h2>The Advantages of Hiring a Professional</h2>\r\n<p>Coursework is a regular feature in the life of the average college student. The constant flow of courseworks demands good analytical and writing skills, and a lot of time&mdash;the coursework demand has never been so heavy for college students. With the emergence of professional coursework writing services, students can now pay for quality, affordable coursework that is guaranteed to get favorable reviews from professors.</p>\r\n<p>Choose an affordable ghostwriter with care by paying attention to their strengths and their ability to replicate your voice. A successful relationship between an author and their ghostwriter is often intimate and long-lasting. Put the extra time in to find the right writer and you will form a relationship of synergy, instead of one based solely on money.</p>\r\n<p>OZessay.com.au is a top-notch essay ghostwriting service.

The basic essay, written in high school or college has a standard, five-paragraph structure. It is important to get familiar and to learn to work with this formula since inspiration alone is not necessarily the key to efficient five-paragraph essay writing. If you have any questions about essay structure - <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Writing Help\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">ask our professionals!</a></strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why Should We Stick to a Particular Structure?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The intention behind having a clear essay structure is to ease on the reader throughout the process of navigation among the ideas which have been put forth in an essay. If every essay has the same form, then the reader, who is familiar with the concept, is able to find quickly the information relevant to them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In spite the fact that there are many types of essays, varying in length, purpose, and format, they all have a common denominator: following a premeditated structure.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Clear and defined structure helps us to organize the flow of ideas, images, and arguments into groups, themes and subjects, all of which will then be used as our building blocks when approaching the construction of the essay.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Structure lets us present our ideas in a clearer way; without it, the reader might lose sight of the point we are trying to make. Having a structure is like having steps which lead into different rooms where our ideas and the points we are trying to make, are presented. Without these steps, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to reach the rooms, and without the rooms, all of the concepts would be piled up together in a mass of material.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">An expository essay is the commonest and the most basic of essays. This kind of work requires the writer to explore an idea, assess affirmations, move further with the idea and present an argument supporting that idea in a brief and comprehensive manner.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The work on this kind of essay implies the use of different tools: definition, example, comparison and contrast, and cause and effect analysis.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Basic Five-Paragraph Essay Structure</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Writing an essay basically, means constructing a number of consistent ideas into an argument. These ideas must be presented in a way the reader can comprehend. A well-to-do essay will attend to the reader&rsquo;s logic. The central point of an essay will dictate its structure through the information and its sequencing.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The five-paragraph essay consists of</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"margin: 5px auto; display: block;\" title=\"Essay Structure\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/essay-structure.png\" alt=\"The five-paragraph essay consists of: 1 introductory paragraph, 3 body paragraphs and 1 concluding paragraph\" width=\"650\" height=\"136\" /></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Introductory Paragraph</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is the paragraph that sets everything off. It is perhaps the toughest to deal with, yet also the most important. This paragraph establishes the tone of the whole essay.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The role of introduction is to establish the topic and to state the thesis. It serves to generate an interest in the suggested subject or raise a question. This paragraph can also show the structure and methodology of your essay. Here&rsquo;s how to build the introductory part:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Topic<br />- Its boundaries<br />- Why it is interesting</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Structure and Methodology<br />- Main sections of the essay<br />- Why do they come in that order<br />- How are you planning to draw conclusions from the information</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Thesis Statement<br />- General claim about the presented information (premise)<br />- Consequences of the above (conclusion)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Make sure your thesis is an arguable claim rather than a fact or an observation. It is essential to come up with a strong thesis; this is the anchor of the whole essay.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A thesis statement should hold an assertion. It has to be something which can be argued. &ldquo;Most wooden tables float in water&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a thesis statement.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This paragraph is your chance to draw the reader in. It is also a great guideline for you when working later on through the rest of the essay.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It should take approximately eight to ten percent from the whole; if your essay should be 1,500 words, then the introductory part would comprise to 150 words.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Body Paragraphs</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">They are also called the supporting paragraphs. Your best and strongest idea, argument or illustration will usually be presented in the <strong>first body paragraph.</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Second body paragraph</strong> will usually include your second strongest idea, argument or illustration.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The third body paragraph</strong> will usually contain the weakest idea, argument or illustration. All of the paragraphs must be anchored and hooked to the end of the preceding paragraph, thus flowing naturally and logically from one another.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The cohesion between all of the paragraphs is necessary to maintain continuity. Here are a few linking phrases and words which might help you with this task. Each group indicates a specific connection:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"margin: 5px auto; display: block;\" title=\"Essay Connection Words\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/connection-words.png\" alt=\"Essay connection words are the following: contrast (yet, on the other hand, but, however), illustration (that is, for example), the next step (then, ultimately, after that), extension (in addition, furthermore, moreover, similarly), conclusion (thus, as a result, consequently, therefore)\" width=\"640\" height=\"180\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Make sure you don&rsquo;t overuse these phrases, especially the ones indicating the time. One of the dangers when writing an essay is creating a &ldquo;walk-through&rdquo; structure, such that follows the timeline of the text, instead of your own argument.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">These are just some of the ways you can connect with the previous paragraph. Another good way is repeating the specific words you have used in the last sentence of the previous paragraph; use them again in the first sentence of the following paragraph, while preparing to develop your next point.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Each body paragraph has to have a topic sentence; this acts as a mini-thesis and will usually come at or near the start.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Concluding paragraph</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This paragraph alludes to the pattern applied in the introductory paragraph. You should restate the original thesis statement in new words or such that will echo with the language previously used. Summarize the three main keynotes from the body of the essay. Give a final statement which will signal to the reader that this is the end of the discussion.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Essay Structuring Tips</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; As soon as you are given an essay question, unleash your thinking. Early bird gets the worm is absolutely true in this case. The sooner you start the more in advantage you&rsquo;ll be.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Brainstorming while preparing for the writing is a good way to generate ideas and see how things relate to each other.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Remember, the title is your most vital guidance. The task you are dealing with is as stated in the title, nothing less, nothing more. Whenever you&rsquo;re in doubt or feeling stuck, go back a step and take another look at the essay title.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; It is better if you write the introductory paragraph in an active voice, and don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;I&rdquo; for other than autobiographical narrative.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; When writing a question essay, make sure you fully understand the question.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">- If it is an open-ended question essay, then narrow it down and explain your choice in the introductory paragraph, to show that you are fully aware of the wider view.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">- If the question is a closed-ended, take a time to think about it; make a list of all that you know: for a fact, maybe know and don&rsquo;t know. Then study whatever it is you don&rsquo;t know.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; In every body, paragraph suggests some kind of evidence. Bring quotes and references to the text you are using, together with a logical line of reasoning and clarification for your own interpretations.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Wherever it is you choose to place your strongest argument, always make sure to keep your focus on the thesis statement. Keep in line with your introductory paragraph to reaffirm that you are steady on the track. Strong-weak-weaker or vice-versa: whichever order it is in, be sure it makes sense.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; It is often helpful to view different parts of the essay as though answering questions your reader may ask when facing your thesis.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Finally, if your essay writing is timed, it is better to have it poorly written but fully structured rather than the opposite.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To write a good five-paragraph essay it is important to prepare well, use various sources and focus on the question in hand. The structure is there for you to have all your wonderful ideas pass coherently to the reader.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before writing the final draft required for submission, spare a minute to proofread your essay to correct misspelled words. Finally, if unsure of anything, always ask for assistance.

Essays can be used to tell a story, persuade an audience on an issue or report on something newsworthy. There are essentially four types of long-form essays, and subtypes exist within each.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><img style=\"margin: 5px auto; display: block;\" title=\"Types of Long-Form Essays\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/writing_articles.png\" alt=\"Types of long-form essays are the following: personal or reflective essays. expository, argumentative or persuasive, analytical and compare and contrast essays\" width=\"640\" height=\"299\" /></strong></p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">What Makes a Good Article?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A good story is about something the audience decides is interesting or important. A better story uses storytelling to make important news interesting. The complication comes because the public is exceptionally diverse in their variety of concerns and interests. So anything can be news, but not everything is newsworthy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A good story adds value to the topic by becoming &ldquo;storytelling with a purpose.&rdquo; Creating a good article means finding important or interesting information, verifying the details, and then presenting it in a way that draws the audience in. Good stories are part of what make journalism different, and more valuable than other content in the media universe.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Article writing is one of the core services our company provides. The kind of articles we can work on is versatile: we can come up with a newspaper article, a blog entry, a review of a product or a service, or we can do a SEO article that is&nbsp;<strong>written specifically</strong>&nbsp;for your needs.

To accomplish this, it is essential that you conduct research, choose your paragraph subheadings wisely, write at least two body paragraphs and tie things in a nice, neat bow with a conclusion that summarizes and sometimes provides supplemental information. Keep reading to learn this process. Here is a brief summary of the parts of an article that flows well and is properly structured.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"margin: 5px auto; display: block;\" title=\"Article Writing Tips\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/article_writing_tips.png\" alt=\"make a research, write an introduction, develop paragraph subheadings, build the body paragraphs, make smooth transitions, and write the conclusion\" width=\"640\" height=\"520\" /></h3>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Research</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Conduct research before you start to draft your essay. Embark on a long-form writing assignment without any thought to the order in which you intend to present material, the final piece will come across as random and unfocused.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Write the introduction</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Introduce your readers to the topic. Think of it in terms of how you act when you first meet someone for the first time: you say who you are, shake hands and say something general about yourself. Everything brought up in the introduction must be addressed in the body paragraphs.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Develop paragraph subheadings</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Develop paragraph subheadings that give your readers a clue about what they are going to read. Paragraph subheadings should stay relatively short, and when possible, make them witty and engaging.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Build the body paragraphs</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Write the body paragraphs&mdash;the meat of your article. This is where you can use the detailed information that you gathered during the research phase. Avoid writing exceptionally long paragraphs, as this discourages readers from actually reading what you write. For a good article, you should have at least two body paragraphs with a minimum of two sentences each.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Create flow with smooth transitions</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Create flow with smooth transition from one paragraph to the next. Look at the first sentence of each new paragraph and make sure it leads into the next subject. How you do this is entirely a personal decision, but providing a transition from one paragraph to the next greatly increases the readability of your article as well as its overall flow.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Write the conclusion</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Close with a brief summary of what you just told readers. Provide information or suggestions for further investigation or include a few additional suggestions your readers can use to learn on their own. Avoid going too far off topic, though, and stay concise. Doing so ensures your well-written article stays that way through the very last word.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;ts of Article Writing</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DO pay attention to your introductory paragraph</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Pay the most amount of attention to the introduction paragraph of your essay. The introductory paragraph not only gives the reader an idea of what you will talk about but also shows them how you will talk about it. Put more effort into crafting a compelling and engaging the introduction and you will be rewarded accordingly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DO NOT use passive voice or I/my</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Avoid personal pronouns like I, My, or Me. Try instead to be more general and you will have your reader hooked. Additionally, using active voice, wherein the subjects direct actions rather than let the actions &ldquo;happen to&rdquo; them &ndash; &ldquo;he scored a 97%&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;he was given a 97%&rdquo; &ndash; is a much more powerful and attention-grabbing way to write.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DO tie things together</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Make the first sentence of your body paragraphs work double time to create natural transitions from one paragraph to the next. Not only should it open with a transition that signals the change from one idea to the next but also it should (ideally) also have a common thread which ties all of the body paragraphs together.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DO NOT be too general</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Make sure all examples are relevant to the thesis. It can be hard to summarize the full richness of a given example in just a few lines so make them count. Details make all the difference when it comes to drawing the audience into the world you are recreating in the essay.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DO be powerful</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Leave plenty of time to invest in the conclusion and use it to leverage all of your research points at once. The conclusion paragraph can be a difficult paragraph to write effectively but, as it is your last chance to leave a lasting impression on the reader. Take this opportunity to restate your thesis with confidence</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DO NOT copy the first paragraph</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Although you can reuse the same keywords in the conclusion as you did in the introduction, try not to copy whole phrases word for word. Instead, try to use this last paragraph to really show your skills as a writer by being as artful in your rephrasing as possible.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why Hire a Professional for Writing an Article?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A professional article writer is trained in seeking out answers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A professional will adhere to ethical standards of journalism, plus they have a knowledge of investigating and verifying information.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some writers are trained in additional skills such as media law, shorthand, social media or editing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Writers have the uncanny ability to rapidly sift through a haystack of information to find the important and interesting needles.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To ensure your articles are well written, you must remember the basic tenant of structure: tell readers what you are going to write, write it in the body paragraph and write it again in the conclusion in a summarized fashion. Do the proper research, utilize paragraph subheadings, write relevant and informative body paragraphs and wrap things up nicely with a conclusive paragraph. Through it all, transition well and create a flow that enhances readability. If you follow these guidelines, you are sure to write one great article after another. And when you need to, hire a professional to write excellent essays every time.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We know how to properly write 100% original articles that will get you an A+ grade.

Despite the high cost and even tougher competition in this market, students keep applying for law schools of all kinds. Obviously, they are drawn by the prestige of the profession, intellectual challenges and financial rewards that are up and waiting for them. Yet, in order to earn a law degree and achieve a high social status, law students need to work ten times harder than any other student. Typical law schools require anywhere from 80 to 90 credits in order to graduate. With some simple calculations, you will see that this equals to about 15 credits per semester, which is quite a load to cope with. Couple that in with the fact that a vast majority of law students needs to work in order to earn their keep as well as pay their loans, the overall workload becomes unthinkable.</p>\r\n<p>If you have found yourself in a similar situation and are looking for help, you have come to the right place. Although <strong>assisting law students</strong> is not as frequent as guiding students who study management or marketing, we do have experienced professionals who can assist you with your assignment and guide you through the process.

This module allows us to provide only original papers, as we have a zero tolerance policy towards plagiarism. We also take immense pride in showing the actual report to our customers. This means that all our customers without exception have the privilege of not simply looking at the similarity index (this is another name for plagiarism score), but also have the ability to view the entire report. In case you see that a certain part of your paper shows a similarity index that is too high we recommend that you message your writer directly and ask him/her to explain this score. Very often it happens that if the paper is high in citations, it will show a higher similarity index than a regular paper. This is especially the case with legal papers, where a lot of quotations and references to the active legislation need to be made. The machine checker is simply looking for matches while running a search of its own, and it shows any matches as plagiarism. Therefore, in this case, the final say is to be made by the support staff &ndash; after they review the paper they will be able to determine whether the paper needs to be redone or not. However, if you need a&nbsp;<strong style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva;\"><a class=\"wicon\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"When you\'re not satisfied with the paper\" href=\"../../if-you-are-not-satisfied-with-the-paper\">revision</a></strong> you can request it by clicking on the &ldquo;Request a free revision&rdquo; link of your control panel. Once you click on it, a new window will appear, asking you for instructions. Simply fill it in &ndash; and you are all set, the writer will then be alerted to revise the paper. If revisions don&rsquo;t help and you want to change your writer, let us know and our staff will review the case and do a quick reassign.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our anti-plagiarism module was been <strong>launched in 2007</strong> and serves us today. We continue to work on improving its accuracy to achieve the best possible results. Therefore, we are checking all papers not only against the text that is available online but also run a brief scan through our database of papers. This helps us to ensure that all papers are <strong>truly authentic</strong> and are not similar to the works completed in the past.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our module works in the following manner: it is separating the text into small blocks, called patterns. Then the system performs a web search by utilizing a so-called \"Rabin-Karp\" algorithm of string text search, thus giving the most precise results, (it even includes sources where the parts of the paper were copied from). This technology was invented back in 1987, and we found it to be an adequate solution for our clients\' needs. The system is powered by such search engines as Yahoo!, Google, MSN.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It has already been mentioned that the system is unable to tell whether a match is an instance of plagiarism or a quotation. Because of this, whenever the paper&rsquo;s similarity index goes beyond 20%, it should be reviewed manually. If the highlighted phrase contains a reference of the original work, then this can&rsquo;t be considered plagiarism. If, however, the phrase does not indicate the original author, this means the paper requires immediate attention. Such papers are reviewed by our team and analyzed for authenticity in a manual mode.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Place an Order\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">CLICK HERE TO PLACE YOUR ORDER!</a></strong></p>','Plagiarism Check','','publish','closed','closed','','plagiarism-check','','','2017-05-16 16:03:40','2017-05-16 13:03:40','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(238,1,'2013-11-01 13:30:07','2013-11-01 11:30:07','','plagiarism-check2-v1','','inherit','closed','closed','','plagiarism-check2-v1','','','2017-05-16 16:03:40','2017-05-16 13:03:40','',237,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/plagiarism-check2-v1.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(239,1,'2012-03-23 20:59:13','2012-03-23 18:59:13','<p>Many people have a natural talent for writing but have no place to use it after their academic career is concluded.

Our studies show that most <strong>problems occur</strong> because of <strong>incomplete or poorly worded instructions</strong>. Our writers are very talented but they aren\'t exactly mind-readers. It\'s better to be overly specific with your requirements instead of assuming the writer will know exactly what research you need them to do. It\'s always a good idea to confirm with the writer before they start writing that they are confident they know what you need.

It takes persistence, patience and a lot of effort on your part. Going from getting mediocre grades into good grades isn\'t going to happen overnight. It takes time to get yourself organized and develop the skills you need to succeed. To help you boost your grades, here are a few simple tips you can start implementing today.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/tips-for-using-the-control-panel\">TIPS FOR USING THE CONTROL PANEL</a></strong></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">1. Attendance Isn\'t Optional</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You can\'t expect to learn anything if you aren\'t actually in the classroom to take in the information being taught. Being present in the classroom is crucial to improving your grades. By just listening to what the teacher has to say, you stand a chance of being able to walk away with at least a C. When you take notes and study further about the subject matter at hand, you are going to boost your grade even further. The skipping class will cause you to lose points and make your grade suffer further.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Keep Distractions to a Minimum</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If there is anything around you that could be a distraction and prevent you from learning, you need to get rid of it. Don\'t play around with your phone, listen to music or sit so far back in the classroom that you can\'t see or hear what the teacher is talking about. Sit closer to the front of the room to make sure you can hear what the teacher is saying and take accurate notes. Don\'t allow other classmates who might not be interested in learning to distract you from bettering yourself.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. Pay Attention to Your Note-Taking</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Whatever the teacher talks about in class, you can plan on it being on the exam. Because of this, you need to make sure you are taking accurate notes that you can study from before the exam. Most of the time, teachers discuss the things that they feel are the most important. With accurate notes, you should have no problem passing the test. Go over everything the teacher discussed and make sure you know the material inside and out. Make note cards, discuss the material with the teacher or a friend, do whatever it takes to come out ahead and make sure the material is embedded in your brain.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">4. Read through Your Textbooks</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Regardless of how much your teacher might try to fit everything into their class session, it isn\'t going to happen. They only have so much time to go over all of the material. Because of this, you have to take it upon yourself to go through the textbook provided and do your own research and studying. For many students, the thought of reading through pages upon pages of text can be intimidating and overwhelming. This is where you need to implement techniques like scanning, skimming and spotting keywords.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Skimming</strong> involves going through and reading just the most important parts of the content. Reading the first sentence of every paragraph can help you pick up what the text is about quickly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Scanning</strong> is where you look through the main parts in a book to figure out whether it relates to your given topic. By reading the preface, index, intro and conclusion, you can get a good idea whether the book is going to help you or not.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Spotting keywords</strong> involve going through and picking out the important phrases or words within the text. Anything highlight in italics or bold tends to be the most significant piece of information in the text. Pay attention for this formatting when reading the text.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">5. Compare Your Notes with the Textbooks</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The key to mastering the material at hand is reading, analyzing and memorizing the materials. Read through your notes, write down any questions you might have and ask your teacher for the answers. You can also search your textbook for answers to your questions. This will help your brain to retain all of the information being taught in class.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So, what are the things we should remember in order to get good grades?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://zipstudy-a.akamaihd.net/images/articles/guide-to-get-good-grades-only.png\" alt=\"If you want to get good grades, pay attention to the following issues.\" width=\"650\" height=\"206\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">By going through the tips above, you can begin improving your grades in no time at all.

Essay assignments account for over 40% of the subject marks in most course modules, which makes essay writing one of the essential academic skills. Developing such skills is not as easy as it seems and this task remains difficult for many students even in their senior years. This is why many students resort to the assistance of essay writing companies who specialize in writing high-scoring essays. Papers that are produced by professional essay writing companies are to be used as sample essays that teach how to write essays effectively. Therefore, if you too are facing difficulties in writing a high-quality essay, get help from a high caliber essay writing company and sharpen your writing skills.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you are finding it hard to cope with your essay writing assignments, do not keep putting off the assignment until the last day before the deadline. Instead, <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Writing Help\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">select a good essay writing service</a></strong> to help you with the assignment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Selecting the Right Writing Service</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The competition within the writing assistance industry is extremely tough, and substandard companies leave the market quickly. Yet, you should be careful when selecting a writing service to work on your project &ndash; remember to choose the service that has experience, credibility and is capable of addressing your needs effectively.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you seek help from a fraudulent or substandard company, you are bound to end up in bigger trouble than if you would attempt to complete the essay assignment on your own. Therefore, make sure to extend due diligence when it comes to selecting the right party for writing your custom essay. It is a better strategy to invest time in the selection of a proper company rather than trying to resolve problems that start emerging at the order completion stage. When searching for a professional essay writer, select a well-established firm, with a large pool of writers as opposed to depending on a single essay writer. This reduces the risk of depending on a single writer who may become unavailable at any point. A company with a large pool of writing professionals can easily switch your order to an equally competent writer immediately, allowing you to still meet the deadlines.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Selection Considerations to Bear in Mind</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you are a student who is searching for a good writing assistance service, here are some key points to consider. Paying attention to these points at the screening phase will help you locate a trustworthy writing service with good essay writers.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li><strong>Website</strong> &ndash; Check the website appearance, quality, functionality and the user friendliness of the writing company. If their web content is written shoddily, the chances of your assignment getting written in a professional manner are quite slim. The site should also facilitate communication between writer, you and staff. The option for uploading files and researched text material should be available as well.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Writers</strong> &ndash; By going through the writer profiles, you can get a fairly good idea of their level and the quality of their writing. Most high-quality writing services engage competent writers with Ph.D. and Masters level qualifications in various subject areas, plus years of experience in the essay and various other academic paper writing.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Customer Service</strong> &ndash; Contact the website via phone or instant messaging systems and assess their level of professionalism and helpfulness in answering your questions as well as their willingness to assist. The level of professionalism of the front desk staff will certainly be a reflection of the quality of service you can expect once you place your essay order.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Price</strong> &ndash; Price is generally the first thing which students would consider, mainly as cash is not in abundance in students&rsquo; wallets. However, we advise you not to choose the cheapest, as you may just end up with a substandard quality essay. It is better to select a writing service which charges industry averages or even slightly more. After all, high-quality writers with Ph.D. or Masters Degrees are highly unlikely to work for very low rates.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Writing Help\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">Request for a custom wrote essay</a></strong> sample that is tailored to all the requirements of your assignment. This will help you learn how to answer your essay question, in the same manner, a professional writer with subject expertise would do. With essay writing assistance, your essay will surely get you an excellent grade. What&rsquo;s more, you will sharpen your writing skills by analyzing professionally written essays completed by the writing professionals.&nbsp;</p>','What You Need to Consider Before Choosing A Writing Service','','publish','closed','closed','','essay-writing-assistance','','','2017-05-17 11:46:33','2017-05-17 08:46:33','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(256,1,'2014-01-31 09:17:32','2014-01-31 07:17:32','','what_to_consider_before_choosing_a_writing_service_ozessay','','inherit','closed','closed','','what_to_consider_before_choosing_a_writing_service_ozessay','','','2017-05-17 11:46:33','2017-05-17 08:46:33','',255,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/images/article/og/what_to_consider_before_choosing_a_writing_service_ozessay.jpg?v=1495616418',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(257,1,'2013-10-25 11:53:42','2013-10-25 08:53:42','<blockquote> <q>Dissertation writing help you may get online from OZessay.</q> </blockquote><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dissertation writing generally comes as the final requirement of a degree program. Unless this requirement is fulfilled successfully, you will not get the degree you have worked hard for. This is not a task that can be done in a few days, nor can it be completed in ad-hoc fashion. Writing a dissertation calls for proper planning and sticking to the planned timeframes for each phase of the dissertation project. Dissertation projects require planning, effort, knowledge and dedication. Students pursuing graduate to doctoral degrees need to submit a successful dissertation that will pass the scrutiny of the dissertation panel. Some dissertations pass on their first submission while others may be returned for minor modifications or for resubmissions with major changes. Dissertations that totally deviate from the requirements, or found to be plagiarized will be rejected or failed by the dissertation committee.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Therefore, all students have a clear understanding of the importance of submitting a well-written dissertation, in order to complete their degree successfully. Yet, despite realizing the importance of submitting a high-quality dissertation, very few students are able to manage this task on their own to a satisfactory level. Hence, many choose to secure dissertation help from a professional dissertation writing service. Exclusive, top quality research papers developed from in-depth research and tailored to your requirements is what you get when you <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Place an Order\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">place your order</a> with <em>OZessay.com.au.</em>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Dissertation Help Can Be Varied</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A dissertation has different components that have to come together to create an outstanding work of academic brilliance. The entire project involves formulating a good dissertation question, conducting rigorous research, reviewing literature, analyzing data and the actual dissertation writing. Students can get dissertation help to handle either one of these components&nbsp;or the whole dissertation. For instance, if you are unable to come up with a good dissertation proposal, you could enlist a professional writer to formulate a good proposal with an interesting and unique hypothesis or question. This will ensure the approval from the dissertation committee to initiate and proceed with the actual study without any delays. The design of a robust methodology, conducting rigorous field research, data analysis and the writing of the actual dissertation are the other aspects for which can enlist dissertation help. For those struggling to grasp the formal writing styles, a professional dissertation writer can be of major help. Besides assisting with academic writing, a dissertation writing service can assist with statistical analysis. A well-established dissertation writing service will provide writers who are able to handle various data analysis software such as SPSS and Minitab, which are commonly used in the dissertation research projects.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">How Can Professional Writing Service Help?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are many types of dissertation help, which can be obtained from a writing service.&nbsp; Students can first and foremost read on various pieces of advice, and go through the free dissertation tips available online. They can also enlist a dissertation writer for writing an outstanding dissertation proposal. Once a writer is chosen, you can request to write either the entire dissertation or its selected chapters. In addition, if you are writing a dissertation yourself, but are not so sure about the purity of your style, you can request dissertation editing. Since dissertations need to comply with strict formatting rules, students can pass on this important task to a dissertation editor who is well versed with formatting and style guides such as the APA or Harvard style.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">While it is indeed a major relief to have a professional writing service to provide dissertation help, securing such services should be done carefully. Due to the virtual nature of the writing services, fraudulent operators can set up websites to scam students of their money. There can also be sites that claim to be professional but lack the resources and qualified writers to deliver quality work. Therefore, when selecting a writing service for your dissertation help, make sure to select a high caliber, well established one with due diligence at the screening phase. When you are allocated a professional dissertation writer, your project can benefit from his or her experience in dissertation writing. Most of these writers have written a number of successful dissertations and know the procedure, style as well as the possible pitfalls. Collaborate closely with the writer and be involved completely, even if you have requested for a <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"../../custom-dissertation\">custom written dissertation</a>. This can ensure that year of effort put in to the degree program is not wasted at this final stage.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-decoration: none; text-align: center;\"><strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Place an Order\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">CLICK HERE TO ORDER YOUR CUSTOM WRITTEN DISSERTATION!</a></strong>&nbsp;</p>','Dissertation Help: Pro Help to Ensure a Place in the Graduation','','publish','closed','closed','','dissertation-help','','','2017-05-15 10:35:32','2017-05-15 07:35:32','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(258,1,'2013-10-25 11:53:42','2013-10-25 08:53:42','','dissertation-help2-v2','','inherit','closed','closed','','dissertation-help2-v2','','','2017-05-15 10:35:32','2017-05-15 07:35:32','',257,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/dissertation-help2-v2.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(259,1,'2013-11-01 13:54:52','2013-11-01 11:54:52','<p>Custom essays help students sharpen their essay writing skills by acting as a sample they can always analyze and refer to.

Therefore, getting a custom essay will be <em>more helpful to a student</em>.</p>\r\n<h2>Why Order Custom Essays</h2>\r\n<p>Students may wonder why they need to order a custom essay instead of simply referring to a free sample essay that is freely available for downloading.&nbsp; This idea could seem especially logical in a situation where you would need to choose between a free product and one you would need to pay for. Nevertheless, we think custom essays will benefit customers more, and here is why:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Custom made</strong> &ndash; Custom written essays are tailored to your specific requirements. From topic selection to the writing style, format, word count and the reference sources, this essay will match the requirements you are setting at the order placement stage.

If you have specific sources to refer to, .e.g. text books, journal articles etc., the writer will incorporate them into the body of the paper.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Custom Formatted</strong> &ndash; Essay assignments need to be properly formatted as per the specified writing style. Some assignments may require APA style formatting while others may require MLA or Harvard style. When you order a custom essay and specify the format you need, this will be complied with accurately.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Writing Help\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">OZessay is the service you can trust to!</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>Summing up, the benefits of a custom written essay outnumber those of a free essay sample.

You can also learn how to structure your papers and write structure them in a logical manner.

At the end of the introductory paragraph you will introduce your thesis statement. The thesis statement is important as it is the one that will be followed in the whole essay. The thesis statement should do the <strong>following things</strong>:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>&bull; Name the general group of items that the essay seeks to classify</em><br /><em>&bull; It describes what are the basis of classification</em><br /><em>&bull; It also labeled the categories that are developed in the essay</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The thesis statement helps readers identify your approach to the analysis. The whole essay should be written in line with the thesis statement. A good classification essay should have an order. The essay should take separate elements and clearly illustrate patterns of connection that are easy for the readers to identify. To show cohesion, it is important that one makes use of comparisons. The comparisons will also ensure a smooth transition from a paragraph to the next one.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The classification and division essay topics can be quite wide. There are several ways that a certain list can be grouped uniquely. It can be according to size, purpose among others. The order that is chosen for grouping will depend on the intended use of the analyzed information. An example is when you are grouping people. You can choose to group them according to their hobbies, their personal relationships or even their wealth. It all depends on the use of the information. Writing an irrelevant piece will not help the readers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before continuing to the body, make sure that you have clearly determined the categories. Be thorough in identifying them this way no important category will be left out. Writing a rough copy will also help in including all the categories. The rough copy also ensures that you get the classification essay topic ideas in order. It will be easier arranging them in the rough copy before proceeding to the final copy. For each category, make sure that you support it using relevant examples. Try and give the same number of examples for each this shows equality in each of the categories.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the conclusion the writer has to draw together the different approaches that they have examined in the body. They should clearly emphasize the purpose for which they were doing the classification. Connect your conclusion to your introduction.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Order of categories</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This refers to how the groups are arranged in the body of the essay. There is a way you can arrange the groups, an example is arranging them from the oldest to the most modern or from the shortest to the longest.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Use an ordering system that will fit the kind of information that you are working with and one that will best suit the purpose of the information. An example is if you are writing about gadgets. You can arrange then in a descending order in terms of price. The first category should be the least important category. This helps keep the reader engaged and interested to see what is most important and they end up reading the whole essay.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When writing a classification essay, remember about&nbsp;<strong>three principles</strong>&nbsp;to maintain consistency in your essay:Select a theoretical framework that you are going to use for your classification</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">1.

Students may know everything about this type of writing assignments but still, wonder how to write a book review worthy of the highest grade. In this article, we offer a simple recipe to create a real masterpiece.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Since there are several types of book reviews, the most frequent requests made by students are as follows:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li>how to write a history book review</li>\r\n<li>how to write a literary book review</li>\r\n<li>how to write a critical book review</li>\r\n<li>how to write a fiction book review</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Despite the fact that the above types are quite different, they still have something in common - a step-by-step instruction to follow to compose a breathtaking review.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">How to Write a Professional Book Review in 4 Steps</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">No matter which review of the above types you are assigned to write, as well as which of the below academic levels (how to write a book review for primary school, how to write a book review for middle school, how to write a book review for high school, how to write a book review for kids), this 4-step guideline will help you in any case get an excellent mark for your review.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 1.</strong> Provide a full bibliographic entry for the book. Include the total number of pages in the book. Some reviews also list the price and ISBN number.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 2.</strong> Do some research about the author&mdash; his or her qualifications, background, experience, previous publications, etc. Note briefly everything about the author that sheds light on the book being reviewed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 3.</strong> Describe the book in several sentences, but bear in mind, a description should not be a summary. Rather, it should extract and state the author\'s main purpose and thesis. In your description also try to reveal how the author achieved his/her purpose.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 4.</strong> Evaluate the book. This part is the longest and the most important one in the review writing process. When writing this part, try to answer the following questions:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>How effectively did the author develop his thesis?</em></li>\r\n<li><em>How well did he/she achieve their purpose?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">How to Write a Book Review Format</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you write the review, try it to be arranged around the central thesis of your evaluation. Adhere to the standard three-part structure: introduction, body, and conclusion.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Introduction.</strong> The opening statement should set the tone for the review. A statement about either the review\'s thesis, the author\'s purpose or the book\'s significance as good options for the opening sentence.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Body.</strong> The body should develop your thesis in a clear, organized manner. It should weave together description and evaluation, providing evidence in support of its judgments.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Conclusion.</strong> The concluding paragraph sums up or restates your thesis or makes the final judgment regarding the book.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you&rsquo;ve ever googled one of the following requests, e.g. <em>how to write a book review essay, how to write a good book review example, how to write a book review template or how to write a book review for kids template</em> be sure, you are in the right place.

Methods.</strong> The purpose of this section is to describe and explain scientific methods that are going to be used in your research.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>4.

To remind, prewriting is the organization phase, i.e. a stage during which the author is planning all the writing, selecting books, journals, and magazines that will be used as sources of information in the actual writing process. This process can take a while and the better you prepare, the better the final product will be. It often happens that preparatory steps take a while (up to a week or two), while the paper itself is written in a matter of hours. Pre-writing is unthinkable without a draft or a rough plan that can be followed during later stages. Writing phase is when the actual writing is done. Essentially, during this phase you will need to take your outline and \'put flesh to the bone\', i.e. add up more information, put proper references and organize the paper. Editing and proofreading are, in essence, the post-writing phase of writing. Ideally, in order to edit the paper properly, you would need to take the following steps:</p>\r\n<p><strong>STEP 1.</strong> Once you have completed the writing stage, <em>put your paper aside</em> for at least a day. Some authors put their papers aside and come back to them in a week or so. This time, allows ideas to settle and ultimately you might get important insights regarding the subject. Alternatively, you might want to rearrange your paper, add or throw out some literature. It often happens, however, that students are working under tight deadlines, therefore a good alternative to putting the paper aside is having someone read the <strong>paper </strong>and <strong>edit </strong>it (if needed). Such second opinion will allow you to look at the paper objectively and point out its drawbacks as well as strong sides.</p>\r\n<p><strong>STEP 2.</strong><em> Look for grammar and spelling errors</em>. Generally, this activity is referred to as proofreading and includes reading the paper for spelling, punctuation, and grammar errors. This stage of writing can and should be done at least several times. For example, you can proofread your paper after completing the writing stage, then give it a couple of editing passes and crown your work with another proofreading round. Again, it might be worthwhile to put the paper aside and get back to it later. Interestingly, some mistakes pass unnoticed if you try to proofread the paper for several times in a row; however nearly all of them get spotted if you look at the writing after some time. Speaking of grammar and spelling: there is a number of automatic grammar checkers you could use, e.g. Grammarly. We wouldn\'t recommend relying on it fully, however, it can do some basic checking work for you, and you can take it on from there.</p>\r\n<p><strong>STEP 3.</strong><em> Check how the paper flows</em>. This involves steps on how well ideas are interconnected in the paper. You should check whether ideas in your paper are connected logically if one flows out of another. The so-called \'stream of conscience\', where thoughts are unclear and unorganized are very hard to understand and track. Make sure the text you work on is cohesive. Text cohesion is attained by use of connective words like <em>therefore, however, on the one hand, on the other hand, summing up</em> etc. These words provide smooth logical transitions between the structural elements within your text. Cohesion will be explained in greater detail below.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why is Text Cohesion Important?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apart from fishing out spelling and grammar errors, using quality and balanced information, you should always bear in mind text cohesion. Basically, it makes the paper flow, ensures it is logically organized and makes it easy to understand and follow. When writing to ensure cohesion, you should pay attention to the following:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n<li>Transition from old information to new</li>\r\n<li>Using thematic words</li>\r\n<li>Ensure parallel constructions</li>\r\n<li>Watch lexical ties</li>\r\n<li>Use transition signals</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You will find a table below that better illustrates each of these elements:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lexical Devices That Ensure Text Cohesion</h4>\r\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid #ebca54; width: 100%;\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #fcf4d6;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-right: 1px solid #EBCA54;\"><strong>Transition from old information to new (ensures sentence clarity):</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #fffae7;\">\r\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #EBCA54;\">The two to three paragraphs following the essay introduction are called body paragraphs <strong>(new information)</strong>.

In terms of volume and from the academic point of view a regular coursework lies somewhere between a <a title=\"Five Paragraph Essay\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/five-paragraph-essay\">five paragraph essay</a> and a <a title=\"Custom Dissertation\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-dissertation\">dissertation</a>&nbsp;project. It prepares students for independent research and teaches them to look for information, interpret and apply it in practice. This type of assignment is most typically found during high school and up to middle university years.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"What Is Coursework?\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/what-is-coursework.jpg\" alt=\"A coursework is a project that is often given to students at any point of their academic career to solidify the theoretical knowledge received in the course and learn to apply this knowledge in practice.\" width=\"750\" height=\"250\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We are&nbsp;experts in coursework writing.

Many students welcome the idea of coursework because it is an opportunity to highlight their academic abilities without dealing with the high pressure that comes with exams, making it ideal for those who want to bring quality to the forefront. But you should know that the extended time lines of coursework in comparison to the exam room time constraints can cause you to take it for granted.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/research-proposal-topics-for-dissertations-or-masters-thesis\">Research Proposal Topics</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/college-students\">College Students</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/five-ways-to-reduce-stress-in-college\">Ways to Reduce Stress in College</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Coursework Structure</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Coursework is just as thought-provoking as an exam, so careful research and planning are necessary to be successful. You must be able to fuse strong data collection and essay writing with planning and <a title=\"Proofreading\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/proofreading\">proofreading</a> to produce top notch coursework. Before you get started with your coursework, you must have a thorough knowledge of the rules to get it perfectly right. Failing to follow the rules will get you a bad grade. Structuring coursework is a key because you don&rsquo;t want your information to look waffled and disorganized. The structure of your coursework should ideally follow these basic factors:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li>Formulate a catchy title</li>\r\n<li>Establish a strong introduction that encapsulates the fundamental ideas behind your coursework</li>\r\n<li>Show clear awareness of the topic in the body through comprehensive research and logical input</li>\r\n<li>Add supporting images, charts, graphs and materials to support and strengthen your research</li>\r\n<li>Add footnotes and bibliography to cite authoritative sites from where you have picked up your research and conclusion</li>\r\n<li>Define a decisive conclusion based on your methodology, research, and analysis</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">How to Write a Successful Coursework&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When looking to prepare coursework, you naturally want to do the best job possible. Following certain rules will help you in your quest.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Tips for Coursework Writing\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/tips-for-coursework-writing.jpg\" alt=\"To write a good coursework you should avoid plagiarism, check your word count, check the topic thoroughly, follow writing style and always proofread \" width=\"750\" height=\"302\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Avoid Plagiarism:</strong> This is perhaps the worst mistake you could ever make and it&rsquo;s more common than you think thanks to the ready availability of information online these days. Everything you write must be in your own words, which can sometimes be challenging &ndash; but it is an absolute necessity. Your teachers will give you guidance in terms of what should be included, so don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask questions &ndash; but never plagiarize.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Check Your Word Count:</strong> Always stick to the recommended word count for your coursework because this will determine your ability to follow instructions judiciously. You should ideally take the time to establish whether appendices, bibliographies, and footnotes are included in your coursework&rsquo;s word count because they can add to your coursework length.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Check Your Topics Thoroughly:</strong> Be sure to know exactly what topics you can cover and what you should stay away from when preparing your coursework. You must be able to cover every recommended topic with meticulous research if you&rsquo;re looking to score well.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Follow Writing Style:</strong> Keep in mind that there are several writing styles for coursework, from APA and Harvard style, referencing to Chicago and MLA writing. This is tough for students who are unaware of each referencing and writing style.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Always Proofread Your Work:</strong> Spelling and grammar are just as vital to the coursework topic itself, so make sure there are no typos by proofreading your work at least once, if not more. Spell check is simply not enough. You will need to go through your work thoroughly to ensure that it is error-free. You can also ask someone else to proofread your work to ensure that you haven&rsquo;t made any typo errors.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When you&rsquo;re writing coursework, you should ideally work in a quiet and distraction-free environment to avoid making careless errors. Treat your coursework with a high degree of reverence and your hard work will pay off in the form of higher grades.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">How to Write A Conclusion for Your Coursework?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Conclusion paragraphs hold your entire coursework together because they summarize everything you have been trying to prove cohesively. A well-written conclusion will draw a clear picture of your coursework, while a badly written conclusion will leave the examiner confused &ndash; which could, unfortunately, affect your grade. The key is to write a unified conclusion without repeating your introduction.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You should ideally start your conclusion paragraph with transitional words like &lsquo;In conclusion&rsquo; or &lsquo;In summary&rsquo; to give your examiner a clear picture that you are wrapping up everything you have covered in your coursework. Keep in mind that the conclusion paragraph is the worst place to represent new facts, so your conclusion doesn&rsquo;t need to have a reference to any <a title=\"Case Study Writing Help\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/case-study-help\">study</a>. The conclusion should be a restatement of the main purpose while summarizing the key coursework points. You may even use your conclusion paragraph as an opportunity to evaluate, estimate and make recommendations for the future.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Coursework Writing Tips&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Coursework writing is an assignment given to students and course attendees to help them achieve good grades. Here are some tips to help you create successful coursework that resonates with your needs:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Undertake Comprehensive Research from Credible Sources.</strong>&nbsp;Research is the most vital element before you begin writing, so make sure you use credible sources for producing high-quality work. You can use sources like the Internet, libraries and scholarly papers for your research. Meticulous planning and research will help you gather all the information necessary for your coursework.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Focus on Your Writing.</strong>&nbsp;Once you finish researching the topic, you will need to put it down in writing. You must plan how you&rsquo;re going to write your coursework so that it will stand out.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Lay Emphasis on Presentation.</strong>&nbsp;Coursework <a title=\"Tips for a Stunning Power Point Presentation\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/10-power-point-presentation-tips-and-tricks\">presentation</a> is key when you&rsquo;re looking to score high. You must pay close attention to how the coursework is presented, along with images, footnotes and other information necessary to present high-quality work.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Stay Calm and Use Time Smartly.</strong>&nbsp;Many students tend to take the extended timelines of coursework for granted, only to find that they are severely time crunched towards the end. Start your coursework as soon as possible, so that you can use time smartly. Beginning early will allow you enough time to conduct ample <a title=\"Custom Research Paper\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-research-paper\">research</a> and planning. You will also remain calm when you use time smartly, instead of being completely stressed out towards the end.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Don&rsquo;t Be Afraid to Ask for Help.</strong>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re not clear about what you need to add to get a good grade, don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for professional help because a cluttered mind will not be able to produce successful work. If you don&rsquo;t understand your topic, ask your teacher. If you want help with writing or proofreading for better success, a professional can help you with that.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Break up Your Work.</strong>&nbsp;The best coursework assignments are never completed in one sitting because they need time and patience to get them thoroughly right. Consider your productivity every day and plan your workload accordingly. This will help you pay more attention to your assignment&rsquo;s content while helping you avoid obvious mistakes.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Successful coursework is highly dependent on research, structure, approach, content, writing style and conclusion.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Where to Get Help with Your Coursework?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Coursework isn&rsquo;t a piece of cake, especially if your grade determines your future career and plans. If you are worried about <a title=\"How to Get Good Grades\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/how-to-get-good-grades\">getting a good grade</a> from your coursework, then perhaps it&rsquo;s time to rely on an expert coursework writing company like OZessay.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In summary, you must always plan well before starting any research topic for your coursework, while presenting your ideas as clearly and logically as possible. Make sure you always back up your good work with proper citations from credible sources because the examiner will naturally want to know how you arrived at your conclusion. Coursework writing must be attractive and appealing with good language skills, so if it isn&rsquo;t your strong suit or if you&rsquo;re simply too stressed to get it right, then <a title=\"Place an Order\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">let the experts at OZessay help you</a> deliver top-notch content that is sure to get you a good grade every time.

To answer the question, examine a case of a leader brought into the business because of great works he/she did in another place. As a new staff and initial time, he/she has not had the chance of getting himself known or trusted or developed a relationship with other employees. If there is a situation within the business that requires immediate action, then the new leader can still lead. Leaders have a character that radiates, inspires, and earns the trust of the people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">A great leader will employ knowledge and intuition to take the business to another level irrespective of the situation. Besides, even in the case of the leader with people, it is not guaranteed that the people would remain loyal. There are possibilities that he/she may lose some or all people since, at critical junctions, other influence members could persuade others to reverse when the journey gets terrain and followers become timid. In the end, the leader is left to reach the journey. However, even without people, he/she manages to reach the destination successfully proving to be on the right track when people leave. Undoubtedly, the leader could lead to goal achievement or better vision. Nonetheless, the major concern is choosing the goals and deciding on the best method of achieving them. A leader, with or without the people, needs to prioritize the strategies of achieving the objectives.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Good leadership is important in every aspect of the society. For the organizations, leadership is important, as they tend to take the personality of their leaders. Through leadership, organizations are able to maximize their productivity, shape the positive culture, and promotion of harmony. For such achievement, it is important to lead individuals and teams through the appropriate style of leadership. Good leaders are driven towards the mission that each member can get behind. Additionally, the leaders know the methods of motivating the teams in an honest, transparent, and genuinely passionate manner. Good leaders understand the significance of employee engagement and what it means for organizational profit baseline.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Within the business, great leaders are important since they motivate and grow the employees, which is important for achieving organizational objectives and ensuring inclusive in performance. They also create loyal customers through creation of an environment that employees shine. Great leaders are passionate brand ambassadors. Instead of focusing on hiring the massive sales force, the business should let the employees handle such situation after the creation of an environment that permits such activities to occur. Great leaders also inspire other people to be great both within the organization and outside.

Initially, the reader will scan your document and put the yes\'s in one pile and the no\'s in the other.&nbsp; If you have great information in your resume or a cover letter that stands out and is easy to scan you will jump into the yes pile &ndash; the detail will be reviewed afterwards.

A thesis statement also acts as the launching pad for the direction that the writer will take in the essay. A thesis statement is just that - a statement that is clear, concise, and will be backed by data. Typically, in most compositions, the thesis statement is in the <strong>introductory paragraph</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many high school students tend to write a lackadaisical thesis statement, with many foregoing the thesis statement altogether. Without a thesis statement, the writer will have a difficult time staying focused on any assertions that they make. Even if the essay deals with a subject that may be straightforward and obvious, the writer will significantly benefit from an essay driving off of a well-thought out thesis statement.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Writing Help\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">Request for a custom written thesis statement </a></strong>sample that is tailored to all the requirements of your assignment.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Who Reads A Thesis Statement?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Anyone who reads your essay inevitably read your thesis statement. Your educator, your teacher, lecturer, professor will read it. The thesis statement informs the reader of the direction of the essay and how you will get there. Similar to an executive summary but not as lengthy the thesis statement is a short, sharp piece of content to quickly inform and digest. It will include details and examples by including strong pieces of evidence to back up the statement.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Understanding the Unique Parts of a Thesis Statement</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many people take the opportunity of an essay to write literary prose that will woo readers. However, the thesis statement is a perfect opportunity to be absolutely direct with the reader. Depending on the topic or the subject, a first-person narrative can easily embolden a thesis statement. For example, this is an example of a compelling, direct thesis statement</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>\"In this essay, I\'ll elaborate on how solar panels can benefit communities, with an emphasis on the environmental benefits of alternative energy sources.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This type of thesis statement is direct, does not leave much room for bias, and will be founded on a treasure trove of information that will persuade and educate the reader. Even though the first-person narrative tends to be the most compelling, the first-person narrative may not be allowed. To get to a powerful thesis statement, the writer needs to ask himself a pretty straightforward question: \"what are my main points that I will focus on in my essay?\"</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">How to Write a Thesis Statement?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">By the end of the first paragraph, the reader should be familiar with what you will be talking about in your essay. The clarity on a college essay hinges on the thesis statement, so it is imperative that it is well-developed to effectively guide the reader.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before coming up with a thesis statement, take the opportunity to brainstorm. Listing ideas will allow you to attack a particular subject from a unique slant, giving you the opportunity to attack a particular subject that might\'ve initially been deemed monotonous. For example, if the topic that you are going to be talking about in your essay pertains to water irrigation systems and which ones work best, then you might start by making a list of different irrigation systems and the different pros and cons of each system. This will give you the guide to create an opinion that will lead to a developed, fleshed out thesis statement.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once you have chosen a certain arguments or perspective, then the research should start. The research is just as important, as it will help dictate the direction of the essay and what type of thesis statement you can adequately back up. The research will help the college writer to gather supporting points that they will touch upon in the composition.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>For the best thesis statement make sure to:</strong></p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Choose the correct kind of paper. Teachers usually assign a specific format or writing style for their papers. However, if you are allowed freedom to choose formatting, then you may be unaware of the different types of articles. An analytical, expository, and argumentative paper tend to be the three most common types of articles. An analytical paper breaks down a particular issue, an expository essay will explain something to the reader, and an argumentative essay will make a particular claim about a topic that will be justified by quality references and citations. Typically, the claim is an opinion or an evaluation.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Limit your topic. Many people make grandiose claims in the thesis statements and ultimately find it hard to find citations and references that will back up their claims. Make sure that your topic is hyper-focused, allowing you to create a concentrated thesis statement.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Remember the purpose of your thesis statement and your essay is to <em>create a debate</em> and is why it is an arguable statement &ndash; it is to prove a <strong>point of view</strong>.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Can You Provide a Sample Thesis Statement?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Yes, we can. However, since there are so many scenarios when one might need a thesis statement, we write and share our thesis statements on a case-by-case basis. Email us with your assignment topic, provide assignment description and we will respond with several high-quality thesis statement samples.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Consider the Meaning of Synopsis</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The description by Bovee and Thill reads <em>&ldquo;A synopsis is a brief overview (one page or less) of a report&rsquo;s (here they refer to writing an executive summary) most important point&rdquo; &hellip; Because it&rsquo;s a concise representation of the whole report, it may be distributed separately to a wide audience&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In this context, consider for your thesis statement how to deliver the most important points in a concise manner and the keywords you can use. Cut down on long phrases that can be expressed by using one or two words. Examples of this are: at the present time to now, with reference to, becomes about, come in contact with, to meet etc.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Consider the type of language you are using for your thesis statement. Is it appropriate, is it easy to understand and suited to the reader&rsquo;s needs. You need to think about making the thesis statement has clarity, credibility, and readability.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Checklist for a Thesis Statement</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To make sure you have in fact written a thesis statement and not just a summary of events take time to answer these questions about your statement:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Checklist for Thesis Statement\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/checklist-for-thesis-statement.jpg\" alt=\"To make sure you have in fact written a thesis statement and not just a summary of events take time to answer these questions about your statement:Have I answered the question?

Make sure you have directly answered the question you have been asked. Sometimes after writing the essay and then quickly creating the thesis statement there is a chance you may have gone off track, even just slightly so it is important to check this simple point</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Is my thesis statement arguable? Try and look at your thesis statement from another perspective or someone else&rsquo;s point of view. If you can hear yourself having an inner dialogue on why others may debate it then you have created a thesis statement.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t then the danger is you may have just written a statement, not a thesis statement.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Do my pieces of evidence or examples work well to support my thesis statement?&nbsp; Make sure you use your most powerful 3 pieces of evidence that are written well and to the point.&nbsp; Remember clarity and readability for any effective communications.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">At <strong><em>OZessay</em></strong> we understand the formula of the thesis statement blueprint.

Unlike face to face interviews, a questionnaire offers far more versatility, allowing face to face, telephone and handwritten surveys.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The primary benefit of creating a questionnaire is that the interviewer does not need to be present, although there are many other advantages for collecting information in this manner. <em><strong>OZessay</strong></em> professional writers will<strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Writing Help\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\"> gladly help you with your questionnaire.</a></strong></p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">What is a Questionnaire?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Creating a&nbsp;Questionnaire is like writing a survey, a tool commonly used for gathering large amounts of information for those who do not have an equally large budget. Since most questionnaires can be utilized without much investment, this popular form of data collection<img style=\"margin: 5px; float: right;\" title=\"Close-ended and Open-ended questions\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/Types_of_Questions.png\" alt=\"there are two types of questions:closed and open\" width=\"252\" height=\"444\" />&nbsp;is considered to be cheap and efficient. Additionally, when needing to collect data from larger demographics, questionnaires have proven to be great time savers where the face to face or telephone interview process seems highly impractical.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Open-Ended and Closed-Ended Questions</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Typically, questionnaires are normally comprised of a mixture of open-ended and closed-ended questions which allows researchers to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. While they come in many different forms, you may recall that closed-ended questions have a list of predetermined answers for those being interviewed to select from. Open-ended questions provide the interviewee an opportunity to answer more candidly, often using a fill-in-the-blank format.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As you might guess, open-ended questions are best suited for interviewing smaller demographics while closed-ended questions are ideal for interviewing and collecting data from large groups of people. In today&rsquo;s busy world, you may also find that interviewees prefer questionnaires using the speedier answering process of the closed-ended questions as they take far less time to complete.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Determining the Limitations of your Questionnaire</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A limitation of open-ended questions might exist if your targeted demographic does not possess the necessary writing and spelling skills needed to fully respond to the questions. This could be due to a lack of education or the ability to express one&rsquo;s thoughts and feelings through writing. However, there are also keen advantages. For example, open-ended questions allow the respondent to inject personality and attitude which gives researchers the opportunity to collect a more elaborate and detailed response.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Questionnaire Example of an Open-Ended Question:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Question:</strong> <em>Please state your job title and the list of duties you are expected to perform on any given day.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Fill in the Blank:</strong> _____________________________________________________________</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Closed-ended questions also offer certain limitations to the questionnaire process by providing a nominal amount of data within any given category. Since there is a clear lack of personal detail using this structure for questioning, researchers are left to wonder if the responses chosen will actually reflect the respondent&rsquo;s true feelings regarding the issue. Even so, these types of questions are ideal for collecting data from a large demographic as they are quick to answer, highly economical and easily checked for reliability.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Questionnaire Example of a Closed-Ended Question:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Question:</strong> <em>I have witnessed or experienced special treatment firsthand in the workplace.</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Select one:</strong> <em>strongly agree - agree - neutral - disagree - strongly disagree - unable to answer</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are several other formats used for both open-ended and closed-ended questions but by viewing these questionnaire examples, you can clearly see the advantages and limitations researchers might come against while collecting data. It is for this reason that many questionnaires offer a mixture of both types of questions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Occasionally, you will also see a closed-ended questionnaire with specific responses for interviewees to check yes or no, followed by a blank section at the bottom for additional remarks. This allows the researchers to gain additional information about the person completing the questionnaire, although these responses may prove to be difficult to categorize for the benefit of the survey.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why Use a Questionnaire?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"margin: 5px; float: left;\" title=\"Why use questionnaire\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/Why_use_Questionnaire.png\" alt=\"use questionnaire for data collection, for bias reduction and for the data analysis. \" width=\"299\" height=\"291\" />Creating a questionnaire allows researchers to ask respondents for specific information and receive direct answers which serves several purposes, including:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; The collection of appropriate data<br />&bull; Gathering date into comparable categories for research and analysis<br />&bull; Reduce bias by formulating and asking every respondent the same question<br />&bull; Increase variety and levels of engagement with survey questions</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">While questionnaires are highly useful and economical, it is believed that these forms of research are designed to support other data and should not be considered a stand-alone or comprehensive form of evaluation for any demographic.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Questionnaires Rely on Honest Answers</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many reasons for this general consensus regarding questionnaires exist, but the primary concern is simply the honesty of the respondent and the validity of his or her response. Not that most respondents are inherently bad, but the concern is that they may not be completely honest in filling out the questionnaire due to social factors.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For example, most respondents would prefer to share a positive image of themselves with researchers than admit to something that might be undesirable or unattractive. For this reason, they may falsify answers in an effort to save face or support a more positive image. In open-ended questions, respondents have been known to exaggerate or to be dishonest in their responses, leaving researchers to wonder how much trust to put into this form of data collection.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Creating a Questionnaire: Structure and Length</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">With a measure of creativity and a strong knowledge about your project goals, you can use questionnaire writing tips such as those listed below to minimize the disadvantages and enjoy the many benefits available to researchers. One of the ways you can ensure a successful questionnaire is by knowing the correct structure and length to use. A well-designed and easy to understand questionnaire that doesn&rsquo;t take too terribly long to complete can also mean a higher response rate.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Top Questionnaire Writing Tips&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here are the key principals to take note of when looking for questionnaire writing tips, as these will offer the highest rate of success in data collection via the survey method:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Consider the goal.</strong> It is important to make sure that each and every question asked relates to the purpose and needs of the research being conducted and the data that will be collected.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Determine the appropriate length.</strong> It makes sense that the longer your questionnaire is, odds are, fewer people will be compelled to complete it, even if you opted for closed-ended questions. Make sure all of your questions are short, clear, and concise, leaving out unnecessary words or jargon.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Conduct a pilot study.</strong> When you conduct a pilot study, you are actually testing your questionnaire on a small group of people to see their reactions and responses. If the questionnaire is not successful with a few, it is not likely to fulfill your data and research needs. At the end of your pilot study, you can ask respondents for their honest feedback and ask for advice on how to make the questionnaire more successful and user-friendly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Ensure the proper order of your questions.</strong> Due to the fact that you want respondents to answer all of the questions contained in your questionnaire, you should list the easiest ones at the beginning. Saving the more difficult questions for last has proven to be successful for those collecting data using surveys and questionnaires.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Reread the terminology used in the questionnaire.</strong> Are all of the questions easy to read and get directly to the point? You should avoid extremely long or complicated sentences and any technical jargon that might be difficult for the average person to understand. When questions are simple and straightforward, the respondent will find them easy to understand.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Does your questionnaire appear to be professional?</strong> People will participate in questionnaires if they feel the information will be beneficial, and not fall into the wrong hands. If your questionnaire does not look polished or professional, respondents may not trust sharing personal facts or information.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Don&rsquo;t assume &hellip;include the instructions.</strong> Not everyone knows how to fill our a questionnaire so be sure to include clear and concise instructions. If your questionnaire is being mailed to respondents, consider marking the envelope in an appealing manner so it is not mistaken for junk mail.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Finding Help with Questionnaire Creation</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now that you know the value and benefits of creating a questionnaire, you may want to find help composing your own survey for data collection and research.

At the&nbsp;university, you are really being asked to write about everything you have learnt, as part of the reflective thinking process. You need to write about your personal thoughts and emotions. Reflection is the ability to think things through. Writing reflective essays is the ability to put those thoughts into writing, and <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Place an Order\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">our professional writers will gladly help you with this task</a></strong>!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your reflective essay is all about your personal outlook and how you felt about a situation, an event, an object, a person and an experience, not someone else&rsquo;s. In theory, there is no right or wrong way on what you write just how you write it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your introduction needs to be strong and engaging. Your body paragraphs need to show analysis and deliberation. Your concluding paragraph needs to reflect back on the content in your essay to create a strong closing statement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reflective Essay Structure &amp; Essay Outline</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A reflective essay is a piece of writing that takes on the general essay format, which is considered to contain 5 paragraphs overall: introduction, 2-3 body paragraphs, and a conclusion. This question has been described in detail in the articles above. The same also holds for the outline: read the article above to better understand how outlines for reflective essays are done.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To write your reflective essay you will need:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">A reflective thinking process</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Self-awareness&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Self-analysis and observation skills that show&nbsp;what and how you have reflected:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The reflective thinking process takes time</strong>. The biggest reflection we visually get every day is when we look in the mirror. Even then it is about our interpretation of what we see that we draw from &ndash; not necessarily what it is. Reflective thinking is similar in the sense that we sometimes see things not as they are but as we are. Profound I know, but this is perfectly acceptable when it comes to writing a reflective essay because this interpretation of an event, situation, even knowledge is exactly what the marker wants to read.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ask yourself why you felt like that about an important world event, personal experience or any given situation. What is it that drives you to have either stronger feelings about some things and not others? What have you learnt from this experience or event?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How you describe your <strong>thoughts and experiences is an important part</strong> of reflective essay writing. Reflective writing is the ability to look back on something and then analyze it internally. It is your interpretation you are being asked to write about.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The art is to create a clear impression or picture in your marker&rsquo;s mind that you have analyzed your topic from your own personal perspective. &nbsp;Then you need to give relevant examples on why you feel this way. The stronger the evidence, emotion, and examples are &ndash; the better.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When asked to write a reflective essay you, in essence, are being asked to create a piece that is your own personal account. Most students find it easier to focus on what was the most significant thing to them when they are trying to write this style of essay &ndash; what really stood out for you that will make it easier to write your essay?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Self-analysis may seem strange but really we do this every day</strong> (especially when we feel we have made a mistake!). We ask ourselves - why did we do this and what could we do better or differently to improve the outcome. This is reflective thinking &ndash; see it&rsquo;s not as bad as you thought.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To self-analyse puts meaning behind your thoughts and helps you determine and explain the important &ldquo;why&rdquo; factor in your reflective essay. &nbsp;In our reflective essay we start with the what happened, then apply our personal interpretation and then talk about the outcome &ndash; what have you learnt and what could you do differently in the future (new ideas/solutions).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you visit <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"../../\">OZessay</a></strong> you will learn <strong>vital tips about how to write</strong> a reflective essay.

A persuasive essay is your opportunity to present an opinion in a convincing manner. The persuasive essay format and structure will be typical for most essays and will have an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Your task is to write an essay that clearly states your opinion that is supported by research. Use this research as evidence to set forth an argument looking at comparisons and contrasts throughout your studies. Use your conclusion to further back up your opinion and summarize any key points.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Read more about a persuasive essay outline and a persuasive essay format here:<br /></em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/persuasive-essay-writing-service\">WHAT IS A PERSUASIVE ESSAY?</a></strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The first step to writing a persuasive essay is locating proper resources.

Your resources will be: time, research, an opinion or argument, key points, examples, evidences.\" width=\"650\" height=\"265\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">First, you need to allocate time if you are to succeed in writing a concise essay. Planning is vital to your success. Think about what times of day you work best and blank those times out in your diary. Writing a persuasive essay requires focus and concentration. Having enough time will ensure you achieve this. &nbsp;To write a successful persuasive essay you need to feel confident about what you are writing about. That is why research is so important, and cramming causes failure.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Research is your number one friend when it comes to writing a persuasive essay. In the book Write That Essay by Ian Hunter, the author states:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\'Many academic essays score badly, not because the student lacked an opinion on a topic &hellip;. but they lacked strong evidence or deeper thinking about an issue\'.</em><strong><em><br /></em></strong></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Here is a great collection of the most popular persuasive essay topics this year:&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/persuasive-writing-topics\">BEST PERSUASIVE ESSAY TOPICS IN 2017</a></strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To have a complete argument you must do the research. Thorough research involves reading a diverse range of material in journals, articles, and textbooks. As you research you will discover articles that back up your perspective and argument that you can use in your persuasive essay. Collect pieces of information from your investigation that helps support and justify your opinion.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Your research helps you form your opinion or strengthens your point of view. Writing a persuasive essay allows you to analyze and compare some results of your research and then present them in your essay. Searching your university or college database you will be thrilled to find a whole host of journals and articles available to you as a student.Your opinion is the lynchpin or anchor that holds your essay together, your analysis and research are what you apply to make your key points in the body paragraphs in your persuasive essay.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When presenting your key points that support your opinion in your persuasive essay use:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Key Points of the Persuasive Essay\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/persuasive-essay-key-points.jpg\" alt=\"When presenting your key points that support your opinion in your persuasive essay use case examples, facts and figures, research or writing of some authority on the topic\" width=\"650\" height=\"105\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Writing key points is a bit like a Q&amp;A session. Continuously revisiting the question every time you present your idea or key points is a way to stay on track. It allows you to go - \'What was the question again?\' It simplifies the process of writing your answer.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In your conclusion, you should first revisit your introduction. This is because you have come a long way since then and you need to show off a bit in your conclusion. It is your best opportunity to show not just what you have learned but how you have learned it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Writing an essay consists of an introduction, body, and conclusion.

That true story part intrigues at least and invites us in at most.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The art of the personal essay is how you deliver your true story. Be honest in your personal essay. Don&rsquo;t shy away from difficult subjects or areas you may feel uncomfortable with. If you are too scared to share the whole truth and nothing but the truth it will tell in your personal essay. The impact won&rsquo;t be nearly as intriguing nor inviting. Give the reader something to dive into and enjoy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A great way to begin your <a class=\"wicon\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Personal Essay Writing\" href=\"../../personal-essay\">personal essay</a> is now. Start to take notes on what you are about to write. Once you get started you will begin the natural flow of creativity. The notes you start today will be the content you can use in your introduction, paragraphs and conclusion. Brainstorm your own memories and personal accounts to develop powerful content.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To master the art of the personal essay, you will be required to explain, analyse, describe and illustrate:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Explaining is the how something has happened. &nbsp;In this case, the personal essay allows you to talk about the topic from your own perspective. The art of the personal essay is a form of self-expression. &nbsp;You get to choose a significant event or position in your life you wish to share.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Who is better informed about your personal life, whether you&rsquo;re talking about your family, a favorite holiday or a relationship, than you? When we analyze we can begin to make connections between events that can help us understand what it might all mean. This is called our own personal account.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In your personal essay you are being asked to express and describe all those accounts so the writer can understand and comprehend your ideologies, what makes you tick in the here and now &ndash; how you feel about these things today.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are some wonderful examples of personal essays and none more so than the author of The Art of the Personal Essay by Phillip Lopate. One of the more popular essay writers of his time he has finely tuned his writing skills to describe and illustrate his lifetime memoirs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In an article written in the New York Times March 2013 by Morris Dickstein describes him as having &hellip; &ldquo;<em>an engaging voice, the projection of the curious, appealingly modest, sometimes self-mocking character behind that voice, and &ldquo;the fluent play of single consciousness&rdquo;</em>. It sounds to us like Phillip Lopate not only has required brilliant personal essay writing skills but he has developed the self-confidence to show and tell who he really is and he isn&rsquo;t afraid to tell it like it is. This is a vital component in the art of the personal essay writing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Whilst Phillip Lopate is obviously one of the geniuses when it comes to personal essays in this same article it states: <em>\"he urges them (the writer) to season their memories with research, ideas, analytic thinking and argument: tools borrowed from more formal essays&rdquo;</em>.

Stick to the main points in your essay and use investigation, contrast and comparison, analysis and examples to hand in an accomplished essay. <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Writing Help\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">If you need help with essay writing - contact our writers!</a></strong></p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">How to Write the Five-Paragraph Essay&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Whether for an assignment or an exam, students in higher education are often required to write the Five-Paragraph Essay. While many are taught early in their academic career how to write this kind of essay, it can still seem a foreign concept for many students at the college/university level. Usually reserved for undergraduates, <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Five Paragraph Essay\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/five-paragraph-essay\">the Five-Paragraph Essay</a></strong> is a fairly simple method of academic writing, with a purpose of having a student demonstrate to their professor that they have completed their assigned reading, have comprehended it, and can critically analyze its content.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This kind of essay also demonstrates the student can make an argument, and can simply evaluate information on a given topic. Most times, instructions may not always specify that the student responds to a question in the form of this particular kind of essay; but unless they are instructed to write an extensive paper or a one-paragraph response to a question, this method of academic writing may serve them best. The student taking entry-level composition courses will be assigned Five-Paragraph Essays because their professors will want the student to build their analytical and writing skills through writing them.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Steps to writing the Five-Paragraph Essay</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">1.<strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Essay Topics \" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-topic\">Select a topic</a></strong> that is not too broad or limited. To organize and coordinate points to make an argument strong, it&rsquo;s best to explore a narrowed topic.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">2.Organize an essay using the basic Five-Paragraph Essay Outline.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The student needs a topic first, and then an introductory paragraph declaring the thesis statement (the statement or theory that is put forward as a premise to be maintained or proved or argued throughout the rest of the Five-Paragraph Essay); a body &ndash; the three paragraphs discussing the ideas or points, one idea/point in each paragraph, with supporting details, and lastly a concluding paragraph.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"margin: 5px auto; display: block;\" title=\"Five-Paragraph Essay Structure\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/five-paragraph-essay.jpg\" alt=\"Five-paragraph essay includes introductory paragraph, first supporting paragraph, second supporting paragraph, third supporting paragraph and the conclusion\" width=\"650\" height=\"899\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">3. <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Essay Writing Guide\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/writing-guide\">Write the essay</a></strong>. This is the result of the writer formulating sentences that are drawn from the outline previously created in Step 2. Writing a successful Five-Paragraph Essay requires a strong topical sentence and a confidently asserted Thesis Statement in the introductory paragraph. Transitions, &ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; &ldquo;Secondly,&rdquo; &ldquo;Next,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Finally,&rdquo; help the reader, and the professor, follow the argument or the claim the student is making in their response to a question or writing prompt. Each of those body paragraphs serves to evidence the thesis &ndash; to build and support a strong argument for the student making the case of something.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Lastly, the student needs a conclusive paragraph to tie it all together. This includes the student restating in a creative, clever way the reasoning behind their argument, or Thesis Statement, and the points supporting that argument. Again, this should amount to a solid five paragraphs, with each comprising five to seven sentences in total.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">4. <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Proofreading\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/proofreading\">Proofread and reread</a></strong> the essay before moving on. The student should read their response at least once before moving onto another question, in the case of an exam, or several times before turning in their essay for a grade. It should be free of grammatical errors, erroneous statements, incomplete sentences, as well as claims that are not supported with logical evidence. They must look to confirm that their essay has argued a position in a thorough, persuasive manner.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">At <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"../../\">www.ozessay.com.au</a></strong> the key point we want to make is your five paragraph essay outline actually makes it easier to write your essay.

You have to find a number of thesis topics and pick one of them so as to progress in your academic career.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As a matter of fact, a thesis paper is not something that you would want to take for granted nor do you want to go hurriedly about it. However, you might be wondering exactly how to choose the right topic in a relatively short period. Normally, there are a number of tips and proposals that you can tag along to speed up this process.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The first and foremost step involved in the composition of a <strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Thesis Statement \" href=\"../../thesis-statement\">thesis topic</a></strong> is thorough comprehension of the assignment by the intellectual. If you fail at this stage, you are bound to face many hardships and disappointments and end up creating a paper that is not up to standards. If a student faces intrinsic doubts at the beginning, approaching the course instructor ahead of the real work is a great idea.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you have questions about essay writing -&nbsp;<strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Writing Help\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">ask our professionals!</a></strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The following are some few tips when selecting a thesis topic:</h2>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">1. Choose an essay that interests you</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Choosing a topic that is of interest to you is perhaps one of the most significant aspects of writing a thesis paper. The course instructor may restrict your selection, but if you get the chance to have a say in the topic selection, try to select carefully a topic that you are passionate about.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Because your thesis paper will need many hours of thinking, reading, and writing about the topic, you will need to select a subject that will at least capture your mind. Think of a topic that gives you a lot of burning questions. These topics may be the ones on which you write down with most eagerness.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Start wide and get narrow</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you set upon a subject that is a bit narrow, it will be difficult to get any helpful or interesting research. Possibly you may be lucky to get some, but not just enough. If such is the case, it is either because there is no adequate information out there, or you are not researching properly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You can lessen occurrences of the latter by researching extensively at the beginning of your paper, and then narrowing your focus as your survey the obtainable research.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. Do not be scared to rework your thesis topic</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When you get to the composition phase of the thesis paper, you may realize the paper begins one way and ends in another way. This implies that you need to revise your topic or thesis statement. Ensure that the paper adheres to a continual line of reason. You should declare the course of the paper and stick to it all through. If at the end of the paper you diverge from your thesis statement or preview in the introduction, revise your preface to take in the turn your argument has taken.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Additionally, to come up with an appropriate essay thesis bear in mind that it will almost certainly take some drafts and revisions to feel comfortable to finalize it.

Yes - you are being asked to make a judgment call but you also have to substantiate it with support and justification. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We love this quote by <strong><em>Stephen King</em></strong>, one of the greatest writers we know:</p>\r\n<blockquote><em>\"you want to remember that while you&rsquo;re judging the book, the book is also judging you</em>&rdquo;.</blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Very clever little ditty and fantastically thought provoking to say the least.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For your critical lens essay we think you can be slightly controversial&nbsp;because the word critical gives you permission to speak your mind. &nbsp;You are being asked to evaluate and apply critical thinking to the material you write. &nbsp;The lens part &ndash; well that just provides you with the vision and the focus.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Hear what <strong><em>Ian Hunter&nbsp;</em></strong>has to say about critical thinking in his book <strong><em>Write That Essay</em></strong><em>:<br /></em></p>\r\n<blockquote><em>\"critically analyse its academic shorthand to discuss the merits and shortcomings of an idea, using research as your source of evidence &hellip; [what] the marker is looking for here is for you to go and find relevant research on the topic, read it, then discuss in depth the merits and shortcomings &hellip;</em>&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Critical Lens Essay Structure</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The overall structure of the critical essay defaults to the five-paragraph format, which means it should consist of the following elements: introduction, 2-3 body paragraphs &amp; a conclusion. Here are several articles that explain the question of essay structure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"../../essay-structure\">Essay Structure</a></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"../../five-paragraph-essay\">Five Paragraph Essay</a></li>\r\n<li><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"../../picking-your-essay-topic\">Picking Your Essay Topic</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The keyword here is relevant research. You see the marker wants you to get it right so they use words like relevant for a reason. &nbsp;This is where you use tools such as support and justification because they are action words. &nbsp;They make you go and do the work. So when you are writing a supporting document you have gathered reasons or evidence on what you have based your opinion on.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The marker doesn&rsquo;t want just random thoughts on why you thought a quote was powerful, or insightful or inspirational &ndash; they want to know why you think this way.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Don&rsquo;t be afraid to state what you believe but be clever enough to remember that your critical lens essay is then asking you to back that up with why you believe your perspective or interpretation, similar to an argumentative essay. &nbsp;They all need analysis; discussion and they all need evidential support applied. &nbsp;Use reasons and examples that use facts to why you believe something to be true. &nbsp;This is what your marker needs to see in your critical lens essay.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A critical lens essay can be a journey of self-discovery. &nbsp;It is not often we are asked to analyze why we think a certain way or why we see the world as we do. &nbsp;It is not even very often we are being asked to give an opinion and maybe this is why the critical lens essay should be more popular, especially for students.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Outside of the academic world continuous learning begins and for students wanting to get into management careers writing business reports can take on a similar format to a critical lens essay because there will certainly be situations you will be instructed to write a fairly hefty business proposal. &nbsp;If you get the format and application right at college and it works well there, you have actually learnt a valuable business tool to take with you into the big, wide world.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The key is to never stop learning, to also think critically but also be open to others people&rsquo;s valuable knowledge and expertise. &nbsp;Once you can do all that, you will become a winner at college and in life.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">At <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"../../\">OZessay</a>&nbsp;we believe it is our duty to explain just how easy a critical lens essay is to write.

Give a summary of the most significant findings and conclusions that can be drawn from the explanation. Also, write about how your results fit in a wider context.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Term paper outline template</h3>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">A guideline to follow:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">An author of a term paper has a responsibility to give the reader information that is beyond what he or she could get from source materials directly. Some of the services that can be performed for the reader may include:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&bull; Research with an investigation that composes a hard-to-find content and joins it in a comprehensible representation.<br />&bull; A synthesis that has diverse things that can be drawn to show how they are related.<br />&bull; An organization that comprises of structure and continuity of diverse items that have been obtained.<br />&bull; Critical analysis where an examination of arguments is done to scrutinise or validity, logic, and defects.<br />&bull; Enlighten on what is difficult by making the arguments to become clearer to whoever is reading.<br />&bull; Show relation of your subject and how it fits in the broader context, in another related field or history.<br />&bull; Take away the irrelevant details so as to be left with the key issues of what is complex.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Research materials</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before you start writing, have a plan or an idea in mind that is genuine and choose a communication that can be understood. An idea is given a boost by reading everything that one can come across related to your idea. Sometimes it appears difficult to keep reading as a dozen materials can be little. Not everything you read will be of importance to you, and you might take time before finding something unique. Take a look at reviews that can be found in major reference books as they can aid in giving additional references and leads. Find some of the scholarly journals and other content that address a general audience like newspapers. Secondary sources like encyclopedias are also very useful as they give an overview of what the primary sources contain.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">A strategy to research</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">General encyclopedias provide you with an overview of the history, people and technical terms you can use to further your research. Some contain bibliographies that give you additional clues of other relations to the subject under research.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Follow the references you get to find papers and books in journals which provide clues for further research.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Use author names to find out if they have written other things.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Try to locate the reviews of the intended books as they contain more information about the books that is not in the books. Review experts are also knowledgeable about the topic discussed in the books.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Knowing people who contribute to the subject is an added advantage. Short articles related to the books will have hidden information that may or may not relate to your research.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Mechanism</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">After researching and writing the content, proof-read carefully to correct errors related to grammar and spelling. Critically go through your work for form and content purposes. Place yourself in the shoes of the reader and you will be able to find deficiencies that come by and provide suggestions to improve. Look for parts that the reader will find difficulty in reading and connect with ways to make it easy. The article should be enticing, and every detail in your work should serve a purpose. Avoid &lsquo;flabby&rsquo; words and if any, replace them with something that is clearer and gives sense to your topic. Avoid colloquial English unless they drive to a point. Unless it is a political speech or something involving romance, also avoid emotion-laden phrases and words.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">An outline of a sample template</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The first part of the outline is usually the introduction, which distinguishes the subject and presents an overview of the reaction you have towards it. The introductory paragraph concludes with your thesis statement that denotes what you learned and whether or not your expectations were met. The thesis statement acts as the main point of your paper. It further offers a transition to the body paragraphs and will be rewarded in your conclusion paragraph.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The body section includes the three or more main ideas that support your thesis statement. All paragraphs in the body section are required to begin with a topic sentence. The remaining part should then support your topic sentence. Always remember to include a transition sentence at the end of every paragraph since this creates a logically and easy to read paper. Also, while you are creating the outline, recognize the subject sentence for every paragraph, and ensure that you include your supporting statements, proof, and your reactions or experiences to the topic under discussion.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Finally, wrap up your paper with a conclusion, which serves as an extra bookend in revisiting and proving the thesis statement you had earlier provided. In creating the conclusion outline, reword your thesis statement and as a recap, include the main ideas from the body paragraphs. Consider not adding further information to the conclusion part, and ensure to add the concluding statement of your term paper.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Sample Term Paper Outline:</h2>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Introduction:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Thesis:</strong> Write the actual one-sentence thesis statement.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Body Paragraphs:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>(I). A complete sentence expressing the main point to support the thesis</strong><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A. For all capital letters, put a phrase representing what you will offer as proof from your research to support the main idea.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. Phrase of specific support/evidence/examples/statistics <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;B.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>(II). Another key point to support the thesis statement; all body paragraphs should have a main point.</strong><br />You need to include many roman numerals as you possess body paragraphs. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;B.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>(III).

Writing needs 100% focus and therefore is a draining task. Schedule your writing time in blocks so you can walk away from it for a while and come back later to make changes and revisions with a fresh mind.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Writing Help\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">Request for a custom written essay</a></strong>&nbsp;sample that is tailored to all the requirements of your assignment.

The first is when someone else chooses provides topics from which the writer must pick. These topics are deemed worthy by someone else and the writer must be confident in the choices laid out by an authority. This arrangement eliminates the stress of having to decide on a topic.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, it is not uncommon for writers to have a topic in mind that does not fit with any of those provided. It is generally always accepted for a writer to approach their editor or client with ideas. As long as they are respectful, and ask if the topic they have in mind would be a possible option for the assignment. If they do not like the idea, a writer should not take it personally.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Methods for choosing a topic</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Thinking early leads to starting early. If the student begins thinking about possible topics when the assignment is given, she has already begun the arduous, yet rewarding, task of planning and organization. Once she has made the assignment a priority in her mind, she may begin to have ideas throughout the day. Brainstorming is often a successful way for students to get some of these ideas down on paper. Seeing one&rsquo;s ideas in writing is often an impetus for the writing process. Though brainstorming is particularly effective when a topic has been chosen, it can also benefit the student who is unable to narrow a topic. It consists of a timed writing session during which the student jots down&mdash;often in list or bulleted form&mdash;any ideas that come to his mind. At the end of the timed period, the student will peruse his list for patterns of consistency. If it appears that something seems to be standing out in his mind more than others, it may be wise to pursue this as a topic possibility.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is important for the student to keep in mind that an initial topic that you come up with may not be the exact topic about which you end up writing. Research topics are often fluid and dictated more by the student&rsquo;s ongoing research than by the originally chosen topic. Such fluidity is common in research and should be embraced as one of its many characteristics.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Tips for the writing process</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are some definite Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;ts for everything that comes after picking the topic. Following these simple rules will keep your grammar and style tight and uniform. The rest of the magic is up to you.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"margin: 5px auto; display: block;\" title=\"Tips for the Writing Process\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/tips-for-the-writing-process.jpg\" alt=\"In the process of writing, you should use page numbers and title, use should say exactly what you mean giving specific information, you should tell the reader something new about the subject, you should start with a clear thesis statement of the main idea and write better than you speak. But you shouldn&rsquo;t use contractions, use slang and clich&eacute;s. You should not use the words &lsquo;really&rsquo; and &lsquo;very&rsquo; to try to emphasize a point and make up words by turning nouns into verbs. \" width=\"650\" height=\"384\" />&nbsp;<strong>DO NOT</strong> use contractions (like &ldquo;don&rsquo;t, wouldn&rsquo;t, shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; etc.). Spell out both words fully e.g. &ldquo;do not,&rdquo; &ldquo;would not,&rdquo; &ldquo;should not,&rdquo; etc.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DO NOT</strong> use slang. If you absolutely cannot live without slang, at least place it in quotation marks (eg &ldquo;Like hey man, lose the groovy lingo. You dig? Later man.&rdquo;).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DO NOT</strong> use cliches. Overused and hackneyed old expressions are usually too vague and need to be put to rest. Cliches are viewed with dismay by most intelligent readers. Using your own words leads to more precision in your word choice and more meaning for your sentence.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DO NOT</strong> use the words &ldquo;really&rdquo; or &ldquo;very&rdquo; to try to emphasize a point (e.g. It was &ldquo;really, very&rdquo; important.) These are almost always unnecessary filler words in spoken language and the written sentence will sound better without the unneeded redundancy (e.g. &ldquo;It was important.&rdquo;)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DO NOT</strong> make up words by turning nouns into verbs e.g. &ldquo;journaling&rdquo; instead of the more correct and older &ldquo;journalizing.&rdquo; Use your Merriam-Webster dictionary.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DO</strong> use page numbers and a title. Make your title interesting rather something dull like &ldquo;Written Assignment 57.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DO</strong> say exactly what you mean using precise word choices and giving specific information to support your proposition or thesis. Define your terms.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DO</strong> tell your reader something new about the subject. Say something significant and important. Do not blather on. Say something thoughtful and intelligent. This will usually require some brainstorming, list making, outlining, and other pre-writing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DO</strong> start off with a clear thesis statement of the main idea. Make sure the first paragraph leaves a good first impression with a thesis statement, fluent writing, and no mechanical errors.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>DO</strong> write better than you speak. With writing, you have the opportunity to catch and correct all of those sloppy little things we tend to do in our spoken English.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Examples of writing assignment topics</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Writing can have many different purposes. You could be observing your school cafeteria to see what types of food students are actually eating, you could be evaluating the quality of the food based on freshness and quantity, or you could be narrating a story about how you gained fifteen pounds your first year at college.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You may need to use several of these writing strategies within the assignment to make it more compelling. For example, you could summarize federal nutrition guidelines, evaluate whether the food being served at the dorm fits those guidelines, and then argue that changes should be made in the menus to better fit those guidelines.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Here are just a few examples:</strong></p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Summarizing is presenting the main points or essence of another text in a condensed form</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Arguing/persuading is expressing a viewpoint on an issue or topic in an effort to convince others that your viewpoint is correct</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Narrating is telling a story or giving an account of events</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Evaluating is examining something in order to determine its value or worth based on a set of criteria.</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Analyzing is breaking a topic down into its component parts in order to examine the relationships between the parts.</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Responding is writing that is in a direct dialogue with another text.</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Examining/Investigating is systematically questioning a topic to discover or uncover facts that are not widely known or accepted, in a way that strives to be as neutral and objective as possible.</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Observing is helping the reader see and understand a person, place, object, image or event that you have directly watched or experienced through detailed sensory descriptions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our high-quality writers are trained experts in custom essay writing.

The most important elements that determine one&rsquo;s writing style are as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>grammar;</li>\r\n<li>punctuation;</li>\r\n<li>words choice;</li>\r\n<li>sentence/paragraph structure.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>One more element your writing style depends on is a type of essay you compose. Let&rsquo;s figure out how a speech type may influence our style of writing. What are the main features of some speech types?</p>\r\n<p>Writing an inspirational speech is characterized by the following features: motivational words, real-life stories, energetic and inspirational sentences, passionate and positive conclusions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Writing a debate speech is characterized by the usage of affirmative sentences, credible information, coherent flow of thoughts, strong arguments that prove your stance.</p>\r\n<p>A speech for public speaking has the following features that make it stand out from the other types of speeches: confidence, passionate and authentic expressions, natural voice, connection with the audience, storytelling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, as you see, each type of speech influences one&rsquo;s manner of writing.

The people, the assignments, and your professor&rsquo;s interactions with students are more intense. So it should be no surprise that a book report is no longer standard either. These are still a requirement and will be so for your continued educational career.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Let&rsquo;s discuss how to write a book report effectively for college. If you want to save your time - <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Place an Order\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">ask our writers to help you!</a></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">What Is a Book Report?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So far, you understand a book report to be a <strong>four or five paragraph summary of the book</strong>, proving to your teacher that you have read and understood the book. On a college level, it&rsquo;s much more complex.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"A Book Review or a Critical Review\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/critical-review.jpg\" alt=\"You must choose a position to agree or disagree with with an author and defend it. You may need to critique the text. The most important factor is to demonstrate your thorough knowledge of the text anf clearly support your position\" width=\"650\" height=\"241\" /></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Most Typical Book Report Topics</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When preparing your book report writing, of course, the most essential piece is discovering your book report topic. Many times your professor will indicate what topic you should write about. Other times, they will leave it up to the student.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Topics vary, including architecture, policies, performances, fashion, and other fields of literature. Don&rsquo;t allow a topic to limit you. If there\'s a listing assigned, select the one you have the greatest interest in or can learn more about. Here are 10 popular topics:</p>\r\n<ol style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li><em>The effect of capitalism</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Building up the character</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Displacement</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Fate and free will</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Injustice</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Knowledge versus ignorance</em></li>\r\n<li><em>The complications of nationalism</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Power of wealth</em></li>\r\n<li><em>The illusion of progress</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Technology in society &ndash; good or bad</em></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Identifying the Theme and Topic</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It&rsquo;s important to know the difference between the theme and the topic. The two are highly similar. The topic is the subject of your literature. It is very specific. The theme is related to the subject but more general. It&rsquo;s what you learn from the literature.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Typical Book Report Structure</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As stated, your book report will consist of more than five paragraphs summarizing the book. There are 4 important pieces of a book report: the introduction and thesis, your opening paragraph, the body, and the conclusion. Although it&rsquo;s only four pieces listed, the body will make up the majority of your book report.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Typical Book Report Structure\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/oz-book-report.jpg\" alt=\"Typical book report consists of introduction and thesis, opening paragraph (summary), body (the book\'s analysis) and the conclusion \" width=\"650\" height=\"141\" /></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>1. Intro and Thesis<br /></strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Your introduction and a thesis are important. As with any other report, this is your opportunity to capture the reader and inform them of what you intend to discuss. Your introduction should include the title of the book, the author&rsquo;s name, and the theme of the book.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here, you will also give your attitude toward the book. Clearly, state what the author&rsquo;s purpose was and if you are agreeing with or against his position. Include your thesis towards the end of your introductory paragraph and ensure it leads into the rest of the paper.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>2. Opening Paragraph (Summary)<br /></strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Your opening paragraph or summary should be brief. Remember, the bulk of your paper should be analytical. So you will refer to other summarizations throughout your paper as well. Your approach to the summary may vary. For instance, if your classmates have all read the book, focus your attention on something more subtle. If it&rsquo;s not well-known, you can summarize a bit more.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>3. Body (The Book&rsquo;s Analysis)<br /></strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The meat of your book report will consist of the body. This is your analysis and evaluation of the book. This needs to be as long as necessary to explain each point of your argument. The organization of these paragraphs does not need to coincide with the organization of the book. You can organize it by methods, themes, or anything else of relevance. Since this is an analytical work, you do not need to over a quote.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>4. Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As with all other works, your conclusion will wrap up your analysis and judgment of the book. You should restate or sum up your thesis again. At this point, all your evidence should have been introduced and clearly support where you stand.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">OZessay - Your Reliable Academic Partner!</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In case you need any help with writing, please do no hesitate to <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Place an Order\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">contact our support team for assistance</a> - our support team will help by connecting you with writers who know exactly how to write a book report.

For a complete analysis, you can&rsquo;t skim through the book. Highlight important passages and take notes as you go.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 2.</strong>&nbsp;Make sure you have a clear understanding of the subject the author is conveying. You want to verify you understand his approach as well.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 3.</strong> Quickly review other reviews of the <a title=\"Book Authors\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/book-authors\">book</a>. This will help you narrow down interesting topics for your own paper. Search through credible sources such as scholarly sources.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 4.</strong> Determine your thesis statement. This should be summed up in one or two sentences and gives your audience a clear understanding of where you stand in your argument. Your theme needs to be specific to the author&rsquo;s theme, writing style, or about relevant characters.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 5.</strong> Gather your credible sources and specific quotes you want to use. Your professor will state in your guidelines the minimum and maximum you should include.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 6.</strong> Using your notes, assessments and reviews, outline your <a title=\"Argumentative Essay Writing Service\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/argumentative-essay-writing-service\">argument</a>, making sure it clearly supports your thesis.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 7.</strong> Now, you will outline your report. Make sure you have at least three supporting points of your thesis statement in the body of your report.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 8.</strong> Sit down and write your report based on your outline and <a title=\"Custom Research Paper\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-research-paper\">research</a> materials gathered. This is considered a draft, so it does not need to be perfect at all.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 9.</strong> Edit and proof your work. If possible, have another peer review your report and offer feedback.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 10.</strong> Make sure to adequately cite your sources. To be successful in college, plagiarism should be avoided at all costs. Your professor will indicate his preferred citation method.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/how-to-write-a-literature-review\">How to Write a Literature Review</a></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/how-to-write-a-speech\">How to Write a Speech</a></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-research-paper/how-to-write-a-research-paper\">Research Paper Writing</a></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/coursework-writing\">Coursework&nbsp;Writing</a></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/argumentative-essay-writing-service\">Argumentative Essay Writing Service</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you are struggling with your book report, OZessay is the company that is happy to help 24/7.

We will begin with this clear introduction, which is exactly what your <strong>opening introduction</strong> (and first paragraph) of your essay should address. In our example of a five paragraph essay we will discuss how long we think the essay should be, the sorts of topics you could write about and how to make your essay interesting (and not too wordy).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here is a scheme that shows the structure of a five-paragraph essay. As we can see, a&nbsp;basic five paragraph essay consists of five structural elements, which are often likened to layers of the hamburger. These structural elements include: introduction, a few body paragraphs, and a conclusion:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Five paragraph essay structure\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/ozessay-five-paragraph-essay-structure-hamburger.jpg\" alt=\"A basic five paragraph essay consists of five structural elements, which are often likened to layers of the hamburger. These structural elements include: introduction, a few body paragraphs, and a conclusion\" width=\"667\" height=\"371\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our <strong>first body paragraph</strong> (your second paragraph of your five paragraph essay) will talk about the length of your essay. Typically most lecturers or teachers will assign the length they would like your essay to be. We think it is best to draft out a word count plan first so you can break your essay down. This is extremely helpful if you feel you are procrastinating and you need a kick up the backside to get the momentum going. If you have been given the instruction that your essay should be 500 words, then the math is simple. Simple break each paragraph down into equal words and now all you have to think about is writing excellent material in 100 words per paragraph.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our <strong style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva;\">second body paragraph</strong> (your third paragraph of our example of a five paragraph essay) is what can you write about. Most lecturers will set the topic but if you want originality then you need to dig a bit deeper into the topic. What is your opinion on what you have been asked to demonstrate? Do you have a strong perspective you want to give? If so this is where you can start doing some research to prove you know your stuff. Don&rsquo;t sit on the fence when you write your essay. You are, in many cases, being asked to give your interpretation or argument to the material so bring it. If you are up for a good debate this is your opportunity to really show key strengths.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our <strong>third body paragraph</strong> (the fourth paragraph of our five paragraph essay) is to help you focus on the structure of your sentences that will create a great essay. First thing, keep your sentences short. Make a statement and then back it up. Use keywords like; in this essay, we discuss the differences, or this is how we can illustrate why this situation/event has occurred. Illustrate is a great keyword because immediately you know what you have to do and your reader is immediately influenced by this strong action word.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In our <strong>closing statement</strong> (our fifth paragraph of our example of a five paragraph essay) we want you to reflect on the points you are trying to make and reiterate them here. Remember your job in your essay is to inform and educate your reader. You want to be seen as an authority on the topic and the better research you have done the better you will write. Your research arms you with vital insights that will help you separate the facts from fiction. Your writing is then just an extension of your research.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Visit <a title=\"Order a Five Paragraph Essay at OzEssay.com.au!\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au\">www.ozessay.com.au</a> where we help you get the latest scoop on understanding essay writing.

It involves not only mastering one&rsquo;s language&nbsp;but is the product of countless hours of, well, actually writing to the point it comes as natural as speaking.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">5 TIPS on Making Your Sentences Shine</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>1. <em>Read. Read. Read.</em></strong> Then read some more. The more familiar one is with their own language (and with excellent writing), the better their own writing will be. Through reading a considerable amount (and often, as in every day and as much as possible), one is able to recognize truly excellent writing; reading, in turn, is practicing writing, because it is an exercise in grammar, vocabulary, cultural idioms, the&nbsp;nuances, and style, etc. What also aids the developing student-writer is reading beyond what is normally relevant and interesting to them. They should read everything &ndash; books in all genres, plays, short stories, blog posts, articles, reviews, the Encyclopedia, religious texts &ndash; as long as they are reading every single day, which is the most important habit for the improving student-writer.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em>2. And, well, write of course &ndash; and do it as much as humanly possible.</em></strong> Like reading on a daily basis, by writing each day the novice student-writer becomes a sculptor of words &ndash; a master of the sentence. This is, in many ways, like an athlete training for a competition. They benefit from practicing seriously for at least an hour day EVERY DAY; it becomes a healthy, fun and exciting habit, and not a chore, which then may become second nature to them, something the student-writer can look forward to each day because they are doing it well. They should write lengthy letters, long, serious, professional-type emails; they can keep a journal, start a blog, write stories &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t matter what writing project they take on, so long as the student writes.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>3. Learn the basics of your language&rsquo;s grammar and style.</strong></em> Writing is pointless without grasping the inner-workings of what constitutes appropriate grammar and style, which is a sort of code that most everyone speaking a particular language can follow, understand and read. There are several books and resources for students looking to improve the understanding of their language and how it should be read or written on paper. The Norton Field Guide to Writing: with readings and handbook helps any English speaker accomplish this goal.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em>4. Read aloud.</em></strong> It&rsquo;s true: the best writing reads how people speak. And by reading your prose aloud you notice errors, like run-on sentences, mistakes in possessive pronouns (for example, using \'they&rsquo;re\' when \'their\' should have been used), as well identifying misspellings and&nbsp;other errors in communicating an idea on paper.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>5. Get and use feedback from others.</strong></em> Quite naturally, writing is a very personal thing, but when the student-writer allows others to read their writing they are most likely receiving an objective evaluation of their writing. Readers, especially those who have much experience with reading, will identify errors in another&rsquo;s writing, either because they may have a better knowledge of grammar and syntax than the student-writer, or even because they may be more well-read than the student-writer asking them to read their work and are more equipped to recognize errors. The student-writer should beforehand also consider the skill level of this reader, to see if their comments are valid, and then determine if their comments are worth implementing into their own writing. In most cases, the reader&rsquo;s feedback will be advantageous.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Wish to know more about academic writing, practice in writing different essay types?

Maybe it&rsquo;s part of our human nature, maybe it&rsquo;s because we enjoy the drama that comes with a hovering deadline or penalty. Procrastination, the action of delaying or postponing something, is part of our daily lives. Whether it&rsquo;s not writing that essay until the very last minute, paying a bill the day it&rsquo;s due rather than long before, or shopping for a holiday the day of that holiday, procrastination happens &ndash; and just about everyone is guilty of it in some way or another.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"margin: 5px auto; display: block;\" title=\"Procrastination is a Thief of Time\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/oz_procrastination.jpg\" alt=\"Procrastination is putting off the to-do list and just wasting your time\" width=\"650\" height=\"517\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But how often do we ask ourselves WHY we procrastinate so much? It is true that life in the Western world in the 21st century is busier than ever, with constant stimulation (mostly due to technology) and a never-ending list of responsibilities that increase as time goes on. What is the reason we put off doing important things &ndash; whether in our careers, in our homes or in our daily lives? And is it a bad thing to procrastinate? At what point does it become a problem?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">People procrastinate for a number of reasons. One is a lack of resources. A task may be put off until a later date if there is a lack of money, tools, time, etc. needed to complete said task. Most times, procrastination is due to a lack of money, as things like bills, payments and financial obligations most always involve money.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">People also procrastinate because they have more important things to do, perhaps because they have bigger problems to solve. They don&rsquo;t set out to intentionally put off completing something; they do it because time is of the essence and they have other things, more important and pressing objectives, facing them. A student may put off working on a writing assignment if they need to study for an exam or prepare for an important presentation. A parent may procrastinate on fixing something in the house because they need to spend that money on feeding their children or paying the mortgage or rent. It calls for an adult decision on a pressing matter, and it often invites justified procrastination.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Other times, people procrastinate out of dread, as well. They choose not to do something because they don&rsquo;t want to do it, or because the process or perhaps the effect of doing it is not so pleasurable or something they want to do. And it&rsquo;s easier to put off doing it until it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary to do &ndash; like yard work, taxes, repairing a home and doing laundry.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In conclusion, procrastination is part of life &ndash; different people for different reasons do it. Quite often, it has its perks and its drawbacks: procrastinating may be helpful for an individual&rsquo;s comfort and pleasure, but in the long-term, it can have negative consequences &ndash; such as financial penalties &ndash; and can prevent one&rsquo;s success. For example, it may be fine to procrastinate on home projects, but never a good thing to procrastinate with work-related obligations and responsibilities. So the individual must have the foresight to know what is pressing and what can be pushed aside for time being. The successful individual may be seen as a person who doesn&rsquo;t procrastinate, someone who does what they are supposed to do when they&rsquo;re supposed to do it regardless of if they want to do it or not. This is how the success guru, writer, and speaker Brian Tracy describes self-discipline as a path to success. Chuck Palahniuk, a novelist of several books including the popular Fight Club, feels people sort of like procrastinating on things in their lives. He seems to believe we need it and openly invite the drama. He says, &ldquo;People don\'t want their lives fixed. Nobody wants their problems solved. Their dramas, their distractions. Their stories resolved. Their messes cleaned up. Because what would they have left? Just the big scary unknown.&rdquo; Maybe people are programmed to procrastinate. Being attracted to conflict, people most likely &ndash; perhaps subconsciously &ndash; put off things because we are always in desperate need of a distraction from the ultimate destination: our own death.</p>','Argumentative Essay Example: Why Procrastination Is a Thief of Time?','','publish','closed','closed','','procrastination-essay','','','2017-05-13 16:18:56','2017-05-13 13:18:56','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(334,1,'2015-03-06 15:02:46','2015-03-06 13:02:46','','procrastination-essay-v2','','inherit','closed','closed','','procrastination-essay-v2','','','2017-05-13 16:18:56','2017-05-13 13:18:56','',333,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/procrastination-essay-v2.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(335,1,'2015-03-06 19:36:27','2015-03-06 17:36:27','<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There is a reason &ndash; or several reasons &ndash; why so much of one&rsquo;s education is spent on learning the craft of writing. It&rsquo;s not because educators are sadists who enjoy watching students toil away on tedious assignments, essays, and papers. Though the student may find writing exhausting and futile, writing assignments are actually helping them prepare for later in their adult lives, where they will have to write out of obligation, necessity or responsibility in their career and in their daily lives. People, mainly adults, write every day &ndash; emails, letters, social media posts, text messages, checks, applications. So it makes sense to embrace it, the act and skill of writing because it&rsquo;s never going away. It&rsquo;s an inevitable thing people in the Western hemisphere have to do. People will always be called on to write out their language; it&rsquo;s a form of communicated that is encouraged and appreciated by society.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"margin: 10px auto; display: block;\" title=\"Writing Skills Boost\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/writing-skills-boost.jpg\" alt=\"Writing is an important part of selfdevelopment of any personality\" width=\"650\" height=\"434\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many people find writing, the medium of communication that represents language through the inscription of signs and symbols, quite enjoyable, too. They were probably the ones inventing stories as a child to pass the time or to combat their loneliness; they were likely writing in a diary or a journal from a young age, a way to deal with their emotions, thoughts, and life experiences. They write stories or essays or articles either for money, for fun or to escape reality. Author Ray Bradbury, in Zen in the Art of Writing, said, &ldquo;You must stay drunk on writing so that reality cannot destroy you.&rdquo; Some people see writing as a puzzle they have to figure out, inserting all the right pieces at the right parts to make up something bigger than was anticipated. Some just enjoy the act of making sentences.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">And, of course, not everyone feels this way about writing. It can present a dreaded element of tedium &ndash; and it often feels like work, even to the best writers. It&rsquo;s not easy doing this: putting one word after another word to make a sentence and a complete thought. It can be like pulling teeth, and the person doing the writing something will often feel like ripping out their own hair multiples times a writing session. But the process can be worth it after something has been written &ndash; to examine, to read, something they created with their thoughts and their language. It comes down to having an expertise and at least a small bit of respect for one&rsquo;s own language. Writing is fun once the basics have been learned &ndash; the grammar and punctuation rules and standards &ndash; so the writer can be free to consider their thoughts, experiences, and even problems and put them down on paper.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Writing is almost as old as civilization itself. Modern anthropologists have found writings in caves that sheltered Neanderthals and historians have discovered ancient writings that were used to record information. Looking back, it&rsquo;s easy to see why even today writing is used ubiquitously in just about all cultures and societies. In many ways, writing has become a crucial way for people to communicate, to convey thoughts, needs, information and emotions to other people.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Writing, once again, is also a great outlet for creativity. Look at poems, songs, movies, articles, books, essays, letters &ndash; they all require writing. Writing something &ndash; the process of working on a project or task that requires the picking and choosing of words in one&rsquo;s language to make sentences &ndash; if looked at with the right attitude and perspective, can be a very affirming experience. But it&rsquo;s also a valuable skill to have. Since most people are required to do it, and because writing is a tedious activity most people do not enjoy, people who write very well have an advantage. People who write well probably write well because they enjoy the act of writing; more than likely, they didn&rsquo;t become an expert at the act of writing. Good writers become bloggers, authors and novelists, journalists and essayists, screenwriters and copywriters, lawyers and marketing geniuses, teachers and business people. Writing is a skill that most people need to have, of course, but one that few excel in.</p>','About Essay Writing: Example Essay from OZessay Writing Service','','publish','closed','closed','','essay-on-writing','','','2017-05-16 15:26:14','2017-05-16 12:26:14','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(336,1,'2015-03-06 19:36:27','2015-03-06 17:36:27','','essay_writing-ozessay','','inherit','closed','closed','','essay_writing-ozessay','','','2017-05-16 15:26:14','2017-05-16 12:26:14','',335,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/images/article/og/essay_writing-ozessay.jpg?v=1495545740',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(337,1,'2015-03-25 17:36:34','2015-03-25 15:36:34','<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Relationships: The Four Pillars of a Successful One</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As people continue to live life, they form relationships with other people, including <a title=\"Free Essay Sample about Family\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-about-your-family\">family&nbsp;</a><a title=\"Free Essay Sample about Family\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-about-your-family\">members</a> and co-workers; and also close friends who become close as if they are&nbsp;considered family.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Relationships &ndash; the way in which two or more people are connected, by&nbsp;blood, by <a title=\"Free Essay Sample about Gay Marriage\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-on-gay-marriage\">marriage</a>, by work, by intimacy, by interests, or by friendship &ndash; require a lot of work, by all the people included.

All relationships depend on it. Everyone has needs and concerns &ndash; and people in good relationships lessen those burdens and problems. Relationships are based on love, and when it comes down to it, love is something that is communicated among people. Information, such as one&rsquo;s needs, concerns, and frustrations, is transmitted through people, mostly through verbal communication. This includes the successful conveying or sharing of ideas, feelings, expectations, too, among people in relationships.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Relationships are based on love, and when it comes down to it, love is something that is communicated among people. Information, such as one&rsquo;s needs, concerns, and frustrations, is transmitted through people, mostly through verbal communication. This includes the successful conveying or sharing of ideas, feelings, expectations, too, among people in relationships.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The second pillar of a great relationship is the people involved having <strong>similar objectives</strong>. A family co-exists peacefully when each family member wants peace and happiness. Two young people who envision a future together both want the same thing; therefore their relationship is based on, among other things, their goal to live together throughout life on a romantic and intimate basis.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Similarities tend to bring together seemingly different people. When people can work together toward a common goal, whatever it may be, they can be looked at as essentially being part of a relationship &ndash; because they were brought together, and connected, by a common task.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Respect and trust</strong>, the last two pillars of a good relationship, go hand in hand. People have good relationships with people they respect and trust. Respect, in this case, indicates to a deep admiration for another person elicited by their abilities, qualities or achievement. Many relationships are formed out of respect, at least in non-familial situations. The same goes for trust, the firm belief in the reliability, truth, ability or strength of someone, or the absence of the truth of a statement without evidence or investigation.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In conclusion, a good relationship isn&rsquo;t simply supported by just one thing, but supported by a number of things. A good relationship where two or more people are connected through something, whether blood, marriage or mutual affection, needs a steady dose of communication, similar objectives, respect, and trust &ndash; the four pillars for any successful relationship.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When it comes to relationships among people, the key is maximizing those moments of selflessness and putting the focus on that other person or group of people. This especially pertains to ones with family members and spouses &ndash; or would-be spouses. But these relationships would also crumble to the ground without the other three pillars &ndash; without trust and respect and commonalities shared and practiced among the people comprising these relationships.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once again, relationships require constant work and focus and patience &ndash; but it&rsquo;s supposed to be worth it: successful, happy and healthy relationships equate to a high quality of life. Research indicates that people need other people in order to live long, happy and healthy lives, which requires happy and healthy relationships among people. It&rsquo;s a simple notion, really. But it works &ndash; and has always worked.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you have&nbsp;a writing assignment&nbsp;to work on, OZessay will be happy&nbsp;<a title=\"Writing Help\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">to assist</a>.

From nonverbal cues to subtle changes in inflections, it\'s a wide-ranging topic that leaves an imprint on everything we do. Looking at what communication is and how it impacts the world around us only improves our perspectives.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The Role Of Communication In Our Lives</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Every connection relies on the simple act of communication. No matter where you are or who you encounter, this function is inevitable. That shop you visit every week, the cab driver that takes you to the airport and the worker you interact with on a daily basis, it all matters.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Think about how you address everyone in your life. Do you speak differently to strangers than you do to the loved ones? Are you cautious about what you write on public comments of a website? These are just some of the areas you face when dealing with the daily challenges of communication. While it may not seem obvious, communication strategy is just another important part of this subject</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Communication and Communication Strategies</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">What is communication? The term communication is often defined as information that creates a connection between people. That extensive definition is as broad ranging as the subject itself. For this reason, it\'s easier to explore the subject by its three distinctive types.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Verbal Communication Strategies</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Verbal communication covers all of the words and speech patterns we use. It\'s often considered the easiest way to relate information to other people. An example of this usage relates to a standard business meeting.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nonverbal Communication Strategies</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Nonverbal communication is an all-encompassing aspect of how we present details to be other people. In many circles, it is also called \"body language.\" Every movement we make&nbsp;both consciously and unconsciously fits into this category. One of the best examples of its use is in a romantic relationship. Subtle body cues such as a person crossing their arms may mean a lack of interest during a date. An opposite reaction would be found in a person leaning forward.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Written Communication Strategies</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Written information comes in every sector. From texts to books, anything that is written falls into this category. The Internet\'s rise in popularity is the leading example of how this type of communication is essential to today\'s society. Just navigating a search engine or blog requires an exclusive database of words and symbols.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">What Spheres Can People Apply Communication Strategies In?</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The act of communication can be applied to every part of our lives. It\'s not just for our personal relationships, the simple act of communicating with another person can increase business opportunities. Among common components of communication strategy, the sphere that seems the benefit the most from careful planning is the workplace. Whether reaching out to a boss or giving instructions to a new employee, this area relies on steady, constant and easy to understand forms of communication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Among spheres, personal relationships can also be divided into sections that see benefits from coaching and mentoring. A communication strategy writing service usually includes all of these elements. They provide valuable tools that address more than just communication strategies to stakeholders.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/strategies-for-communication.jpg\" alt=\"Communication\" width=\"750\" height=\"363\" /></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Communication Strategies In Different Cultures</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Every culture views communication differently. Words that you might say to someone in one culture might be viewed as an insult in another. Understanding those subtle differences is key to creating a social or professional bond.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Businesses throughout the world are encouraging global commerce. This push towards having employees and connections throughout the world highlight the importance of communication strategies in the workplace. Having insights into the world\'s cultural differences can lead to better deals that help you as well as your company finds success.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">In terms of personal connections, communications can be even more difficult to navigate. Relationships grow and change based on how we communicate with one another. Adding cultural differences makes it tricky, but easy to work with if you have the right counseling.

No, college is not for everyone, but those who do get the privilege of attending a university or college, a school of higher education, find themselves getting to take a break before real life sets in. Other 20-somethings are working 40-hour jobs, raising families, paying bills and mortgages. College undergraduate students &ndash; a majority of who are 18 to 22 years old, or maybe a little older for graduate students &ndash; get to attend classes, hear lectures, sleep in and stay up late. But they also get to learn things &ndash; fun things, things that matter, things that will help them for the rest of their life.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">After graduating from high school, many people have a very important decision to make: is it best to jump headfirst into the work force and get a job right away? Or would it be smarter to think ahead and get a strong foundation of education, such as a bachelor&rsquo;s degree? Statistics indicate that people with a college degree tend to have more earning power over someone without one, which means they will make more money and may also have a higher quality of life during their lifetime. Education goes a long way. To many, it&rsquo;s part of an essential recipe for success. There are many sayings about success and what it takes, why it matters, how it&rsquo;s accomplished, how it is sustained over a long period of time. There is one school of thought that says a person&rsquo;s level of success matches their ability to have foresight. In other words, when a person can look ahead, long into the future, to make current decisions that affect their future, they are likely to be successful. The same is true with the opposite, as well.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many factors decide if one attends college: such as finances, aspirations, talents, intelligence, and character, to name only a few. In some families, a person is expected to attend college after graduating from high school. It is not only a tradition in their household but a rite of passage. Attending college and graduating with a degree, for some, is something they are expected to do because having an education will not only benefit them their entire life, it is also a valuable experience during which they learn a lot about themselves, about the world around them, and about life. In college, students are taught important bits of knowledge that help them to better understand the world, to better understand people &ndash; including themselves &ndash; and they learn important skills that are valuable and needed in the real world. They are taught critical-thinking skills, communication and interpersonal skills, research and language skills. And since the point of education is to become self-educated, students in college are trained to be resourceful and successful in the real world. This means they are taught, over and over and over again, to find the answers to things they do not know; and they&rsquo;re taught how tofind solutions to problems.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The college years are a very exciting time in one&rsquo;s life. It&rsquo;s when a person has their entire future in front of them &ndash; and it&rsquo;s a future that looks very appealing and pleasant. Yes, it&rsquo;s a time of fun, of celebration and excitement. But it&rsquo;s also a time for working hard, studying, preparing and discovering what it is one wants to become in life, in their career, and in their personal lives. The work incollege is not easy but quite demanding and hard. There is a ton of reading for long hours, conducting tedious research, and students in college spend a lot of time writing &ndash; which, let&rsquo;s face it, is not everyone&rsquo;s favorite activity. Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s more thanworth it: spending four or so years learning and better one&rsquo;s self to make one&rsquo;s life better and more fulfilling. It seems like a no-brainer.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/essay-about-college.jpg\" alt=\"Essay about College\" width=\"650\" height=\"308\" /></p>','Essay About College','','publish','closed','closed','','a-story-of-college-life','','','2017-05-17 12:58:31','2017-05-17 09:58:31','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(342,1,'2015-04-03 19:23:20','2015-04-03 16:23:20','','college_essay_ozessay','','inherit','closed','closed','','college_essay_ozessay','','','2017-05-17 12:58:31','2017-05-17 09:58:31','',341,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/images/article/og/college_essay_ozessay.jpg?v=1495698261',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(343,1,'2017-03-08 15:37:59','2017-03-08 13:37:59','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The question of whether to buy essay or to write one from scratch is something that many students inevitably consider when they get overwhelmed by the volume of homework that has to be done. Despite all the implications, we believe it&rsquo;s definitely worthwhile to buy essays online as opposed to trying to do everything yourself. There are two main reasons for that:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Manage Your Academic Workload</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You won&rsquo;t be able to do all your homework yourself anyway, - you will have to balance your academic workload, giving priority to subjects that are more important over those that are less important. Usually, buying essays online pays off for subjects that are not directly related to your major, for example: management, marketing, literature and so on. Most students take management, marketing, literature classes, but for just a small share of them are these disciplines a major. So go ahead and buy essay if this is your case &ndash; it might really pay off by saving your time.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Focus on Your Area of Expertise</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can&rsquo;t specialize in every single subject. In some cases, it is worthwhile to outsource tasks that lie outside your area of expertise; to do so, make a list of companies that offer academic writing and then pick the best website to buy essays from. Our service allows you to actually focus on your area of expertise by taking that unnecessary homework pain away and allowing you to concentrate on your major, your work or your family. After all, there is nothing more important than that.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Buy Best Essay Writing Services in Australia</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finding a custom writing service to buy an essay from can be a tricky process.

The growth of websites that sell essays and other academic papers makes it extremely difficult to make a choice. Some of those websites offer expensive essays for sale, while others offer to buy cheap essay writing services. While it&rsquo;s certainly up to you to decide what service to go with, we recommend that you take the middle path &ndash; choose a service that offers a reasonable price tag and go with it. In case with a cheap essay writing services, for instance, they often claim they can write at a Ph.D. level and charge as little as $6-8 per page. &nbsp;<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The truth is that quality research requires high-quality writing professionals, who will only work if the payment is high enough. We have been able to find the optimal solution and bring our commission down to the minimum to allow you to enjoy the benefits of quality custom essay writing services.

He said that it should be up to local forces to directly engage ISIS in such a manner. This quest for new war powers, however, was met with dissent from both sides of the aisle. Win Without War, a progressive organization against the U.S.&rsquo;s purported overuse of military force in their foreign policy, condemned Obama&rsquo;s seeking an AUMF in a statement emphasizing the need for a non-militaristic solution.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We strongly urge Congress to reject the pursuit of a military solution to a conflict that does not have one [&hellip;] American bombs have been falling on the Middle East for decades and they have only served to destabilize the region and prolong conflicts. We must recognize that no Congressional action will suddenly end the conflicts in Iraq and Syria. (qt. in Taintor)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Also against the AUMF, Rick Santorum, a former Senator from Pennsylvania, criticized President Obama&rsquo;s proposal as being too limited in scope, stating that the U.S. could not effectively engage ISIS with the restrictions the president was placing on the military in his proposal (Taintor).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This new push for U.S. involvement came after the news that Kayla Mueller, an American aid worker who had been taken hostage by ISIS in August of 2013, had been killed in a coalition airstrike in Syria. Mueller, who had previously done humanitarian work in India, Israel, Palestine, and Turkey, was captured leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria. President Obama, who had previously stated that the U.S. was utilizing all available to rescue Mueller, offered his condolences to her family, promising retribution. &ldquo;No matter how long it takes, the United States will find and bring to justice the terrorists who are responsible for Kayla&rsquo;s captivity and death,&rdquo; (qt. in Vinograd). Kayla was believed to be the last American hostage held by ISIS after the terrorist group had beheaded three others not too long after a failed rescue attempt carried out by U.S. Army Delta Force soldiers. Official reports stated that several ISIS combatants were killed in the operation, but the hostages were never found (Vinograd).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A month later, the U.S. was leading a coalition of the willing in the fight against ISIS in Iraq alongside Iraqi and Iranian troops. Officials stated that after receiving a formal request for American military support from the Iraqi government, U.S. airstrikes began almost immediately. The Iraqi military had wanted to engage the ISIS forces in Tikrit, the hometown of former leader Saddam Hussein, and take back the city from ISIS control without informing the U.S.; but they, unfortunately, fell short in their objective. Iraqi President Fouad Massoum stated, &ldquo;The Iraqi government along with residents of the area wanted an active contribution from the international coalition,&rdquo; in their quest to defeat and demoralize the terrorist group, (qt. in Youssef). After a long-standing policy that the U.S. would not collaborate with the Iranian military, though now it seems the two have a common enemy. As of March 15, 2015, the U.S. had conducted 5,314 airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq, though local militias in Iraq have begun to protest the expansion of U.S. involvement in the fight (Youssef).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Works Cited</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Taintor, David. \"Obama Asks for New War Powers: ISIS Is \'going to Lose\'\" Msnbc.com.

It is an essay on games and sports importance. If you are searching for another argumentative essay topics, read the great list we\'ve composed of the most interesting ideas and topics:</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-essay/persuasive-essay/topics-and-ideas\">35 MOST INTERESTING PERSUASIVE ESSAY TOPICS</a></strong></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sports in America are under attack lately, especially the more violent ones &ndash; like football, hockey, rugby and even baseball. Even in high school, athletes are dying on the field &ndash; and it&rsquo;s all too scary. College and pro athletes are risking their lives every time they step on the field. They are getting spinal and brain injuries and the abuse they take will haunt them for the rest of their lives. It is horrendous that this happens to people every day all around the world. And this means that fewer people begin playing sports in the first place.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Despite all of this, there are still many benefits to playing sports as a young person, as in before one hits the workforce (or even while they are still in a working adult). People learn essential life lessons playing sports, lessons that will play to their advantage for the rest of their lives.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One benefit of playing sports is learning how to collaborate with people on a given task or objective. People who have played sports a great deal understand how to work with others, how to get the best out of people, and how to help people do what they do best, in order to win the game. Sports condition and encourage people to put aside differences, grudges and personal incompatibility for the sake of the task at hand. This comes from being on a team and working with people, who are often complete strangers one would have never normally come into contact with. People who have played sports learn the true meaning of ownership and of \'we\', and hardly give themselves credit when it&rsquo;s directed at them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Dealing with adversity, and therefore building character is another benefit one gains from playing sports with other people. People deal with adversity every day &ndash; in their careers, families and even communities. Playing sports as a young person teaches a person to not only expect adversity &ndash; losing, essentially, or failure to be successful at something, like getting struck out in a baseball game &ndash; but to anticipate how they will handle it. This translates into a person&rsquo;s adult life where they come across adversity on a daily basis: getting fired from a job, not getting a promotion, getting reprimanded by a boss, losing a big business deal, dealing with an angry co-worker who doesn&rsquo;t like you. Playing sports from an early age can help a person to accept adversity with grace, class, and optimism later in life. They become better people for it, too.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As a side note, it should also be acknowledged that another benefit to playing sports is exercise and making the habit of exercising. For exercise helps a person relax and handle stress in a healthy, moderate, controlled way. A relaxed, happy person is going to naturally be a better person to work with, a better person to hire and a better person to be around because they are their optimal self. Exercise invigorates people and can help them feel at ease and confident, which can help them become successful.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When it comes down to it, it appears that the benefits of playing sports &ndash; both as a child, teenager and adult &ndash; outweigh the associated risks. Of course small injuries are part of any strenuous exercise, and some sports are more dangerous than others, and of course some people are not healthy enough to play sports, but the playing of sports really can and does provide a person with lasting benefits &ndash; ones that extend into their personal, social and career lives. In spite of this, a person should never avoid playing sports solely for this reason. There is much to learn by playing sports, for they are something that can teach people character and how to work with others &ndash; especially people who are quite different from them &ndash; and it teaches people to try new things, things that may aid in making them a better person.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Did you like this essay on sports?

Don&rsquo;t Procrastinate on Completing&nbsp;Assignments&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Life and its great responsibilities are already stressful enough without procrastination. So it&rsquo;s better to get simple, quick tasks over and done with than holding onto them until they&rsquo;re to be submitted for evaluation. Or when they just need to be done. Also, though it&rsquo;s a challenge to do so, stress can be avoided if large, tedious, research-based assignments are started when they&rsquo;re first given, then completed long before they are due. This allows for more time to make the assignment as perfect as possible. The same goes for other stress-inducing realities, such as paying bills, and other responsibilities. Instead of holding onto things until they create a giant ball of stress, get into a habit of getting things done &ndash; and done early!</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Make Being Social a Weekly or Even Daily Priority&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Just being around other people is enough to enhance one&rsquo;s mood. Engaging in social activities (such as volunteering, having weekly coffee with friends, going to see plays, films, concerts and art exhibits) is known to help a person decompress. As people are alone, they are more prone to dwell on themselves, their problems, their responsibilities, thoughts, and worries that in turn have a negative effect on their stress levels. But as long as people are in the company of others, they are often distracted from themselves and their personal problems. So they experience a reduction in their own stress. Aside from this diversion, there&rsquo;s another reason that having a robust social life does wonders to combat stress: through being social, or by habitually engaging in activities that force interaction among people, people also form building relationships with other people. Strong relationships with others will often provide a person with countless opportunities to share their problems and developing a strong support system, which in turn can be psychologically and emotionally relaxing and comforting &ndash; which will also lessen stress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. Establish a Productive, Effective Daily Routine&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">With routine comes structure &ndash; and that&rsquo;s what a college student needs in order to lessen their level of stress and be successful in earning their degree. First of all, one&rsquo;s sleeping patterns and stress go hand in hand. Someone in their early 20s needs at least seven hours of sleep a night. Of course, they can surely get by on less than that, but making a habit of getting little sleep is one way to increase one&rsquo;s stress levels. Sleep, by its very nature, releases certain hormones and chemicals in one&rsquo;s body that are known to keep stress at a manageable level. Also, it is good to keep regular sleeping patterns, like sleeping through each night rather than sleeping little during the night and napping during the daytime. It goes back to our circadian rhythms. The same goes for eating three meals a day around the same time. The human body needs to meals throughout the day to maintain bodily functions &ndash; which affect things likes blood pressure and irritability, hypertension, etc. Eating healthy foods throughout the day brings a mellow energy in people. Many foods are known to relax the body and reduce stress.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">4. Exercise at Couple of Times a Week, For a Half Hour</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It&rsquo;s no secret that exercise is good for a multitude of things &ndash; one of which is lessening stress. Exercise releases serotonin and endorphins that aid the body in fighting inflammation, illness, and sickness &ndash; and even helps to fight stress. Plus exercise relaxes the body. It is now well known that weekly exercise plays a crucial in reversing the detrimental effects of stress. Whether by walking, jogging, stretching, doing calisthenics, yoga or lifting weights, there are tons of ways to get active and get rid of nagging, unproductive and awful bits of stress.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">5. Get Some Perspective!&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Surely, college is overwhelming. There are tons of opportunities at every corner, doors to be opened, things to get done and accomplished. Only it seems there are never enough hours in the day to get everything done. But student&rsquo;s must remained focused on the main goal: to get a graduate with a degree so they can get a job in a few years. A lot of stress comes from one&rsquo;s need to be perfect and excellent in everything &ndash; every single task, assignment, essay or exam. A lot of stress is self-created. Remember that. And don&rsquo;t stress about imperfection. One of the ways to reduce stress is assigning some of your writing assignments to the&nbsp;writing professionals. The writing service is meant for college students and helps them better cope with their writing &amp; research. One needs to just do their best, work hard, turn things in on time &ndash; and they will be fine for the most part and will graduate. And employers aren&rsquo;t looking for perfection, but for the character, intelligence, hard work, and dependability. When it comes down to it, a student is likely to encounter low amounts of stress if they become comfortable with imperfection &ndash; to an extent.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our high-quality writers are trained experts in custom essay writing.

This is to uphold Democracy and to prevent dictatorships and authoritarian government practices, to keep the country free, Capitalistic and Democratically fair to the people. The three branches making up the United States government are the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches, as seen in the President, the Supreme Court, and Congress. To understand why things are done this way, it&rsquo;s important to know a little about each branch, what it does and why it is important. This further assures the American citizen that they live in a country run, in theory, by the whole population who select people to represent them, their needs and their challenges.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The President of the United States of America is not the only one running the show. For their time, for at least four years, they are essentially heading the Executive branch of the United States government. Though they are the commander-in-chief of the American military, the President does not have unlimited power to rule the country. The President is intentionally limited in power so as to prevent a regime, where a leader has complete control over every single government entity. The Vice President supports the president in various affairs as part of the Executive branch and becomes a liaison with the Senate. Cabinet members are also part of the Executive branch and assist the President in decision-making and other responsibilities. The President can veto some bills not passed by Congress, which means the President does have certain powers not shared by members of the other branches.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Supreme Court and its Justices make up the Judicial branch. They determine if certain laws work in correlation with the United States Constitution. The President nominates each Justice, and their positions have to first be approved by a majority of those in the Senate. The Judicial branch makes sure the country&rsquo;s entire law-making system is done correctly, fairly and in the name of true and fair justice and Democracy. This branch sees that the country is run legally with respect to providing citizens their Constitutional rights. The Judicial branch has the power to decide if certain laws should be incorporated into the life of everyday Americans. Most recently, the Supreme Court Justices determined that Federal bans on same-sex marriages were unconstitutional. Once that bill passed and became a Federal law, individual states were able to vote to determine if they would allow same-sex marriages.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">And the Legislative branch, essentially the United States Congress, in many ways collectively chooses the country&rsquo;s laws and what becomes part of the Constitution, which is always being amended to reflect today&rsquo;s society, its people and its needs, challenges, and limitations. The Senate and the House of Representatives make up the Legislative branch of the American government. The Senate has 100 members, exactly two from each of the 50 states; and the House of Representative has 435 members, representing the various districts of the American population (the more populous places get more representatives). Together, they determine if certain bills should be laws to protect the rights of the people.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In conclusion, the three branches of the American government works &ndash; and this system has worked for more than 200 years. The system of checks and balances is by no means perfect, as seen in how President vetoes some bills that Congress is unwilling to pass. This, of course, creates mistrust among the various branches, in turn preventing effective cooperation between the departments of the government. Nonetheless, as time goes on, this system will evolve and will one day become the common way governments all around the world will run. It equates to happy citizens who make up a happy, successful and self-preserving society.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"order-today\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Place an Order\" href=\"../../order\" rel=\"nofollow\">ORDER YOUR CUSTOM-WRITTEN ESSAY TODAY!</a></p>','Essay About Three Branches of Government','','publish','closed','closed','','essay-about-three-branches-of-government','','','2017-05-17 13:06:09','2017-05-17 10:06:09','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(352,1,'2015-09-10 20:03:09','2015-09-10 17:03:09','','three-branches-of-government3-v1','','inherit','closed','closed','','three-branches-of-government3-v1','','','2017-05-17 13:06:09','2017-05-17 10:06:09','',351,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/three-branches-of-government3-v1.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(353,1,'2016-12-29 10:33:55','2016-12-29 08:33:55','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/persuasive-essay-writing-service\">persuasive essay</a>&nbsp;is an essay that uses reason along with logic so the person reading it can see that one idea is more justifiable than another idea.

Cancer is a serious disease caused by the spreading of abnormal cells to other parts of the human body. Breast cancer, in particular, is marked by a group of cancer cells generally known to create a malignant tumor or lump that starts in the cells of the breast. This group of cancer cells then spreads to the lymph nodes or to other organs through the bloodstream. This sometimes, unfortunately, ends in death and illness in many people.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The development of breast cancer can be broken down into several stages; it is important to understand what each stage represents because of cancer, especially breast cancer, is so ubiquitous in American women. The breast cancer stages use numbers that range from 0&nbsp;to 4. Each stage implies that cancer has been diagnosed, and as the numerals get higher, it means that the cancer is more advanced.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>Stage 0:</strong></em> This stage refers to noninvasive cancer that is diagnosed early. It stays in the breast ducts where it started. It is highly treatable and generally may go away with the right treatment and care.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>Stage 1 Breast Cancer:</strong></em> This stage refers to cancer that is starting to attack healthy tissue. It is usually called \'invasive\', this particular kind of cancer. Here the tumor may be the size of a peanut. In Stage IA, the cancer cells have moved into the fatty tissue of the breast. In Stage IB, small amounts of cancer cells have invaded the lymph glands. It too is highly treatable and goes away with the right treatment and care.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>Stage 2 Breast Cancer:</strong></em> This stage refers to cancer that has grown and spread. In Stage IA, the tumor is still small but has most likely spread to the lymph nodes. In Stage IB, the tumor had grown to the size of a walnut or even bigger and may have found its way to inside the lymph nodes. It requires more aggressive form treatment but it is treatable, fortunately enough.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>Stage 3 Breast Cancer:</strong></em> This refers to cancer that is advanced but has not yet spread to the bones or organs. In Stage IA, up to nine lymph nodes are infected and form a chain from the underarm to the collarbone. In Stage IB, the tumor has grown into the skin around the breast or into the chest wall. In Stage IIIC, cancer has spread above or below the collarbone or has been found in 10 or more lymph nodes. This stage is considered advanced but there are a number of treatment options.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>Stage 4 Breast Cancer:</strong></em> This refers to the most advanced stage of breast cancer. The cancer cells have spread to other organs, usually the bones, liver, lungs, and brain. It is usually described as \'metastatic\', meaning that the cancer cells have moved beyond a region where it was first discovered. Stage IV cancer is considered incurable. Stage IV breast cancer does not mean that a person has to give up on life or relationships as there are treatment options that will lengthen life. A strong support group of family and friends will help as there are tough decisions that need to be made. The strenuous cycle of treatments can be exhausting. Many women with Stage IV breast cancer have discovered a renewed strength of character, as well as qualities of resilience that they never knew they had.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is important to know and understand the stages of breast cancer and the breast cancer treatment options available. Cancer, these days, does not necessarily mean death and debilitation. There are so many treatment options available, so many new scientific discoveries and options, that people are able to combat certain types of breast cancer and triumph.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>If you are to write any type of essay on health issues or nursing, here is a collection of sample topics.

Those enterprises supplying these commodities and services, whether food supplies, sports cars or healthcare services, are faced with marketing their products or services to consumers, the people who will buy the products or services because they need or want them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Marketing Essentials</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Marketing is done through TV, print or online (digital) advertising, through publicity, such as articles and blogs and photographs in circulated publications, and through many other methods, as well. The goal is promoting, showing, demonstrating and advertising services and products to the consumer &ndash; the people with the buying power who can make a <a title=\"Business Essay\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/business-essay\">business</a> successful.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In any case, an enterprise develops a marketing strategy it believes will effectively promote a product or service. But not every strategy is effective, and the market is also constantly changing &ndash; which is what necessitates the 7 P&rsquo;s of Marketing: Product, Price, Promotion, Place, Packaging, Positioning, and People. By considering its marketing approach in the context of each &ldquo;P,&rdquo; an enterprise is able to assess its effectiveness in hitting goals, in making sure it&rsquo;s heading in the right direction &ndash; that it&rsquo;s ultimately making a return on investment. It&rsquo;s a sort of checklist, a test, for marketing strategies.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img title=\"7 P\'s of Marketing\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/marketing-seven-ps.jpg\" alt=\"7 P\'s of Marketing\" width=\"650\" height=\"314\" />&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Product</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Product&rdquo; means that an enterprise takes an objective look at the market to determine if there is a need, in other words, a market, for their product (or service). This requires market <a title=\"Custom Research\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-research\">research</a>, the gathering of statistical information on market trends, and a long, hard look at what they are selling to the consumer. If there is no demand for it, there is no market for that particular product/service.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Prices</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Prices&rdquo; refers to the assessment of what the products or services are being sold for, the literal prices on the market. An enterprise is to evaluate the demographic they cater to, and if the prices of what they are selling are appropriate to this demographic. They have to remain relevant to the consumer and be sure their prices compete with others in the market while making sure to consider the notion of supply and demand.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-on-change\">Free Essay Sample: Changes in Our Life</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-on-failure\">Essay Sample: Failure as a Part of Success</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-on-writing\">Free Essay Sample: What Does Writing Mean to You?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/business-essay\">Essay Sample: Business These Days</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/english-essay\">Strategies for Effective English Essay Writing</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Promotion</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Promotion&rdquo; is all the ways to tell customers about the products or services, or how these goods are marketed and sold, whether through print and digital advertising, billboards, <a title=\"Article Writing\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/article-writing\">articles</a> and social media. Each enterprise should ask if their marketing method is relevant to today&rsquo;s consumer. Maybe traditional print advertising is not reaching their demographic, for example, which may be a young generation. The market changes, and so does the consumer in regards to how they hear about products and services.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Place</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Place&rdquo; is evaluating the effectiveness of where the product or service is sold, where customer meets the product. Different products and services belong in different places, and the enterprise must determine if the placing of their product is best for the demographic they are trying to reach.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Packaging</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Packaging&rdquo; is an evaluation of how the product is presented to the customer. This requires considering things from the perspective of the consumer. If marketing promises one thing to the consumer and doesn&rsquo;t deliver, the customer loses trust in that brand and will hesitate purchasing that product or service in the future &ndash; which of course is quite bad for business.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Positioning</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Positioning&rdquo; is how the product or service, even the enterprise, and the brand, is positioned &ndash; negatively or positively &ndash; in the hearts and minds of the customers, the consumer. This&nbsp;is a crucial determinant of <a title=\"Four Pillars of Successful Relationships\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-about-relationships-four-pillars-of-a-successful-relationship\">success</a>. Of course, positive positioning is best. So if a business finds they&rsquo;re negatively positioned, they can make the changes promptly to begin positioning themselves positively in the minds of their customers.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">People</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;People&rdquo; refers to the people, inside the enterprise, who are responsible for every element of sales, marketing strategies, and activities. These people have crucial responsibilities. They hire, recruit and train the best people for each job, after of course getting the right people for the job.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/career-person.jpg\" alt=\"Career Person\" width=\"648\" height=\"354\" /></p>','Essay on 7 P’s of Marketing','','publish','closed','closed','','the-seven-ps-of-marketing','','','2017-05-16 14:49:00','2017-05-16 11:49:00','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(358,1,'2015-09-24 15:02:37','2015-09-24 12:02:37','','7-ps-of-marketing-ozessay','','inherit','closed','closed','','7-ps-of-marketing-ozessay','','','2017-05-16 14:49:00','2017-05-16 11:49:00','',357,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/images/article/og/7-ps-of-marketing-ozessay.jpg?v=1495544265',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(359,1,'2015-10-02 18:58:02','2015-10-02 15:58:02','<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I have known my hero my entire life.

I&rsquo;m very close to them, my hero, who is also a protector, guardian, and friend, of sorts. My hero is a family member. No, my hero is not a sibling, cousin or parent. My hero is my paternal grandfather &ndash; Sgt. David Berkowitz. (I have changed his name to protect his identity. I hope you do not mind.) Of course, I look up to my parents and appreciate the heroic things they&rsquo;ve done for me and for others and for each other. But their life accomplishments can&rsquo;t come close to my grandfather&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"My Hero is my Grandpa\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/rsz_shutterstock_279770255.jpg\" alt=\"Grandpa with his grandson are reading a book and laughing \" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Just a few years into college, after enduring a poor, nightmarish childhood in the Bronx, New York, my grandfather enlisted in World War II. He was a first-generation American, born of Polish parents of Jewish descent. His father was a failed businessman who became a drunkard too young, who took the family down with him. Everyone except Ira. He managed to graduate from high school with honors and got a scholarship to Columbia University in Manhattan. He was going to be a doctor, or so he thought then.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Right after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, my grandfather enlisted in World War II. He was only 20 at the time, just a junior at Columbia. Like so many other heroic men and women of \'The Greatest Generation\', he sacrificed his dreams and goals for his country and countrymen. He had just been named the editor of the school newspaper. When he enlisted, he was ready to battle the Nazis and protect the world from evil. Nonetheless, a few months later, after basic training at Fort Bragg, he was shipped to Washington, then to Paris, Amsterdam and finally Dresden, where he was to be a war correspondent. During his few years in Europe covering the Great War, he wrote 153 stories about the war.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">After the war, he graduated from college on the GI Bill and started writing scripts for fun &ndash; films, sitcoms, dramas, radio plays. He remained a journalist on the side, of course, writing first for The New York Times and then The Paris Review. He sold his first script at age 30 to Universal Studios &ndash; and then on was able to write scripts each year to live on comfortably enough to raise my three uncles and my mother. My grandma, Lora, was able to quit her job at the library to help my dad manage his records and keep track of hundreds of manuscripts. Now &ndash; today &ndash; they live in sunny California, in Los Angeles, where Grandpa is close to those he works with in the film industry. He drives nice cars, has a large home with beachfront and mountain-top views, he is happy, wealthy and happy &ndash; and the work he does every day \'is far from work\', he says. \'It&rsquo;s more like playing around with toy soldiers and play fighting than actually working or doing a job. A job is being a reporter. That is work. This scriptwriting stuff I do ever day is the most fun I&rsquo;ve ever had by myself\'.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I am so proud of him, my grandpa Ira, because he went from nothing &ndash; a life of struggle, poverty, hardship &ndash; and created a legacy of freedom, self-respect, creativity and success. He has lived selflessly, diligently and intelligently. I look up to him in so many ways, and I want to emulate his life. His children never embraced writing and storytelling like he did, and says I have his penchant for doing it. He often says: \'Talent sometimes skips a generation\'. Grandpa Ira is my hero &ndash; and he has earned that title. His life has been anything but ordinary, and he&rsquo;s left an impression on me that I will be holding onto for the rest of my life.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you were searching for narrative topics and found this essay to be a good example, then you are in the right place <a title=\"Order Page\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">to order</a> a plagiarism free and well-written narrative essay on your hero.

natural order of the universe. Falling under this umbrella is how nature <a title=\"Essay on Changes\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-on-change\">changes</a> with weather and the amount of each day&rsquo;s daylight, climate, weather patterns, etc. The four seasons &ndash; Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter &ndash; are a primary example. A year &ndash; the cyclical nature of the fleeting seasons &ndash; can be seen as a metaphor depicting the <a title=\"A Story of College Life\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/a-story-of-college-life\">cycle of life</a> for a human being: From birth through adulthood and into old age and ending with death. This further emphasizes mortality, which is part of the natural order of things.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Like a newborn baby, life comes first &ndash; and so does Spring, the emergence of life, a time of birth and creation. This can be seen as illustrating the birth of a human being, or any life form for that matter.&nbsp; Flowers and trees are coming alive after the long, dark winter &ndash; and it&rsquo;s a time of death and nothingness or nonexistence. As the days grow longer and there are more hours of daylight, everything, all of nature, begins to grow and blossom. This is much like the first 20 or so years of a person&rsquo;s life, when they are first born, then grow and blossom.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"../../\">OZessays.com.au</a>&nbsp;writers utilize their analytical skills, scientific and systematic thinking process, rigorous research and art of writing to produce superb quality papers.

It&rsquo;s also a time of self-exploration, as in <a title=\"Writing Career\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/writing-career\">choosing a career</a> and finding success and figuring out what makes them feel productive and happy and healthy. This is quite similar to the summer months of the year, in which plants are flourishing and in their prime when they are at the height of the year lives. In the summer season, it seems time is never-ending, with no hint of the season ever ending and certainly no thoughts of life&rsquo;s end, no apprehensions of withering away because of old age. This is a metaphor for the phase of one&rsquo;s summer years, with the season lending itself as an appropriate depiction of this time in one&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n<li><a title=\"Essay Sample\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-about-yourself-example\">Essay About Yourself</a></li>\r\n<li><a title=\"Essay Sample\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/example-of-a-five-paragraph-essay\">Five-Paragraph Essay Sample</a></li>\r\n<li><a title=\"Essay Sample\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-about-zombies\">Sample Essay about Zombies</a>&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Fall is naturally a beautiful season, one that is comparable to middle age. There is still much life and beauty in the plants and landscape during this time of the year. However, the days are getting shorter, there are fewer hours of sunshine in each day, prompting a change in the foliage. Leaves transform from green to yellow, brown and orange, at least in much of the United States, and they wilt away and fall to the ground. Though this makes a splendid sight, it represents the first signs of wilting away, of death, in people. The leaves fall to the ground making the trees lighter and more resilient for the proceeding winter months. Fall represents the golden years, the years after 40 and before 70 or so, where life begins to change; it&rsquo;s the time right before old age when people experience changes in their lives and in their bodies, inwardly and outwardly, when they, quite, unfortunately, start experiencing the signs of death, of withering away slowly and inevitably. Nonetheless, this is just a time of a natural transformation, and because of that is quite beautiful in and of itself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Lastly, winter comes. This is a time of decrepitude, of illness and death. The days are short, the nights are long, and most days are unsightly, depressing, lonely and dark. Of course, snow falls in winter, these winter months have not been traditionally well liked or enjoyed compared to the more aesthetically appealing seasons, such as summer. Winter is much like the time after a person&rsquo;s productive years. It is a time of wisdom, dying and finally death. Trees essentially die off in winter. Just like people tend to die in old age, in their elderly years. In winter, the days the shorter, the same the days get shorter for people, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A person can find comfort in observing the four seasons this way. People are afraid of death, of change, and so they begin to resist the natural order of the universe. But if they can see the change as inevitable, that death is part of life, they can find solace in letting go and just going with the flow, so to speak.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We guarantee you high grades and academic success.

Tarantino, however, denies that this is the case: \"I\'ve been asked this question for 20 years, about the effects of violence in movies related to violence in real life. My answer is the same as 20 years ago &hellip; I don\'t think one has to do with the other,&rdquo; (qtd. in Grossberg).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Just strictly looking at the figures, it&rsquo;s easy to see why so many have rallied against the filmmaker&rsquo;s use of violence. In a 2013 article published by Vanity Fair in which they added up the number of on-screen deaths in all of Tarantino&rsquo;s films, eight films in total, and they found that there had been approximately 563 total people killed on-screen, with the 2009 war film, Inglourious Basterds, taking the top spot with 396 approximate on-screen deaths, and the 1997 crime film, Jackie Brown, tallying just four.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">And it&rsquo;s not just the number of deaths seen in the films: The manner in which these deaths have been portrayed has been growing increasingly diverse. All of the combined deaths from his first three films were from firearms alone, but as the director moved on from the crime film genre, the on-screen deaths became more creative. For example, in the martial arts action films, Kill Bill Volumes 1 &amp; 2, there were countless on-screen deaths from samurai swords. Inglourious Basterds not only showed deaths by firearm, it also showed the scalping of dead Nazi soldiers by the American troops, as well as the burning of a French theater filled with Nazi officials, including Adolf Hitler himself, (Beggs and Handy).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Following his latest release, the controversial Django Unchained, the director found himself in hot water again, not only because of the frequent use of the N-word, but because of the events that occurred Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, on December 14, 2012. Advocacy groups condemned the film for its portrayal of violence, stating that films like these can, and have lead to, acts of violence like the Sandy Hook shooting.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Tarantino, however, expressed his annoyance that he has to defend his films every time there is a tragedy in America. &ldquo;I just think you know there&rsquo;s violence in the world, tragedies happen, blame the playmakers. It&rsquo;s a western. Give me a break,&rdquo; (qtd. in &ldquo;Quentin Tarantino is &hellip;&rdquo;). Regardless of the filmmaker&rsquo;s views, The Weinstein Company, the studio behind Django Unchained, cancelled the film&rsquo;s premier out of respect for the victims after news broke of the Sandy Hook shooting.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Dr. Pamela Cantor, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and president of the American Association of Suicide, believes that Tarantino&rsquo;s statements were &ldquo;ill-informed.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Big screen movie makers and the media in general have a responsibility here as their depiction of violence and guns are not doing any good because they normalize violent acts making society immune to them.&rdquo; Even the star of the film, Jamie Foxx, agreed with what Dr. Cantor said, stating in a press event, &ldquo;We cannot turn our back and say that violence in films or anything that we do doesn&rsquo;t have a sort of influence. It does,&rdquo; (qtd. in &ldquo;Quentin Tarantino is &hellip;&rdquo;).</p>','Essay on Quentin Tarantino','','publish','closed','closed','','essay-about-quentin-tarantino-movies','','','2017-05-17 10:55:17','2017-05-17 07:55:17','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(366,1,'2015-10-23 19:04:06','2015-10-23 16:04:06','','essay_on_tarantino-ozessay','','inherit','closed','closed','','essay_on_tarantino-ozessay','','','2017-05-17 10:55:17','2017-05-17 07:55:17','',365,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/images/article/og/essay_on_tarantino-ozessay.jpg?v=1495626485',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(367,1,'2015-10-30 19:55:54','2015-10-30 17:55:54','<blockquote> <q>Here is a free sample essay about family relationships. Read it to see the ways the author describes the family. </q> </blockquote><p>My family is made up of a bunch of one-of-a-kind people. They are happy, joyful people, they are successful, but they are also rooted in humility and gratitude.</p>\r\n<p>My mother and father were born to poor families from Virginia. Their parents &ndash; my grandparents &ndash; were sharecroppers, people who worked the tobacco fields for peanuts, for just small amounts of money on which to survive. But they had big dreams of living a better life.</p>\r\n<p>In the 1940s, after being married for 20-plus years, they established a business &ndash; a small restaurant in Petersburg, Virginia. Ten years later they sold the restaurant &ndash; which had by that time become a chain &ndash; and they became millionaires overnight. They then invested much of their money, in turn increasing their wealth. They got into real estate, corporate finance, and other investments. For two people without a college education, they were still very intelligent, perceptive and had impressive foresight. They have always been wise in their decision-making.</p>\r\n<p>My mother then inherited their estate once they passed on, and she went on to have the financial security to pursue her dream of becoming Hollywood screenwriter. She was fortunate enough to have sufficient money to support herself even if she failed as a writer in Hollywood, which of course she did not do.</p>\r\n<p>I was 15 when we moved to Los Angeles, California. After sending in spec scripts to various TV shows, she received an offer to write scripts for a soap opera and a children&rsquo;s show &ndash; and she ultimately had some scripts made into episodes. By this time, she had divorced my father, who at the time was the owner of a large corporation, a construction company in South Carolina. So when we moved to Los Angeles, it was just the two of us. We were a team, and we learned to live together. It was hard at first, me a teenager in this big, scary, foreign city. But it took her three years before she completed her first screenplay. It was a love story, in many ways based on her life and love story. It sold a year later to Universal Studios. Yes, we were already quite wealthy. But she wanted to be successful on her own terms. She wanted to live out her own destiny, leave her own mark on this world. And she did.</p>\r\n<p>Now I am in college, soon to graduate with a degree in Creative Writing. I have dreams of following in her footsteps: I too want to have my scripts made into films and TV shows. I am writing too &ndash; all of the time, actually &ndash; and it&rsquo;s what I want to do with my life and my short time on this crazy planet. I want to be just like my mother, who has always been a sort of hero to me. She is happy and successful, she has been able to make a career out of writing professionally &ndash; and she loves the life she has created for herself. Yes, she has been wealthy most of her adult life, but that fact had nothing to do with her finding success in writing. And I really admire that about her. Did coming from a wealthy family make success a bit easier? Sure. But she did the writing, she put in the work each day, and she has made it.</p>\r\n<p>My family is not an ordinary bunch, nor is my family an ordinary American family, at least in my mind. I realize that we have had more opportunities than most families, but that doesn&rsquo;t make me better than anybody else. I just have more advantages than most, and I&rsquo;m very grateful for that &ndash; and I\'m glad I can acknowledge this. I owe everything I have today to what my grandparents and parents accomplished. It is because of them that my own success may come a bit easier than most.</p>',' Essay About Your Family: Describe Relationships as a Professional Writer','','publish','closed','closed','','essay-about-your-family','','','2017-05-17 11:46:45','2017-05-17 08:46:45','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(368,1,'2015-10-30 19:55:54','2015-10-30 17:55:54','','essay-about-family-v2','','inherit','closed','closed','','essay-about-family-v2','','','2017-05-17 11:46:45','2017-05-17 08:46:45','',367,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/essay-about-family-v2.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(369,1,'2015-11-05 18:08:24','2015-11-05 16:08:24','<p style=\"text-align: left;\">American society as a whole is becoming increasingly more accepting of gay marriage. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean everyone is on board with it. Quite a bit of the more Christian and Conservative citizens of the country state it a sin against God. The idea of a marriage is strictly between a man and a woman &ndash; Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">According to the Bible, marriage is heterosexual&nbsp;<em>by definition</em>. \"From the beginning of creation, God made them male and female. For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh...\" &nbsp;The Bible alone, however, does not have to be used to demonstrate this understanding of marriage. The biblical viewpoint of marriage has been the universal understanding of marriage in every human civilization in world history. History argues against gay marriage. Modern secular psychology recognizes that men and women are psychologically and emotionally designed to complement one another. In regard to the family, psychologists contend that a union between a man and woman in which both spouses serve as good gender role models is the best environment in which to raise well-adjusted children. Psychology argues against gay marriage. In nature/physicality, clearly, men and women were designed to &ldquo;fit&rdquo; together sexually. With the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; purpose of sexual intercourse being procreation, clearly only a sexual relationship between a man and a woman can fulfill this purpose. Nature argues against gay marriage.&nbsp;To give sanction to gay marriage/same-sex marriage would be to give approval to the homosexual lifestyle, which the Bible clearly and consistently condemns as sinful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Homosexual couples using in vitro fertilization (IVF) or surrogate mothers deliberately create a class of children who will live apart from their mother or father. Yale Child Study Center psychiatrist Kyle Pruett reports that children of IVF often ask their single or lesbian mothers about their fathers, asking their mothers questions like the following:\"Mommy, what did you do with my daddy?\" \"Can I write him a letter?\" \"Has he ever seen me?\" \"Didn\'t you like him? Didn\'t he like me?\" Elizabeth Marquardt reports that children of divorce often report similar feelings about their non-custodial parent, usually the father.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One of the biggest threats that same-sex \"marriage\" poses to marriage is that it would probably undercut the norm of sexual fidelity in marriage. In the first edition of his book in defense of same-sex marriage,&nbsp;<em>Virtually Normal</em>, homosexual commentator Andrew Sullivan wrote: \"There is more likely to be greater understanding of the need for extramarital outlets between two men than between a man and a woman.\" Of course, this line of thinking--were it incorporated into marriage and telegraphed to the public in sitcoms, magazines, and other mass media--would do enormous harm to the norm of sexual fidelity in marriage.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One recent study of civil unions and marriages in Vermont suggests this is a very real concern. More than 79 percent of heterosexual married men and women, along with lesbians in civil unions, reported that they strongly valued sexual fidelity. Only about 50 percent of gay men in civil unions valued sexual fidelity.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Traditionally, marriage and procreation have been tightly connected to one another. Indeed, from a sociological perspective, the primary purpose that marriage serves is to secure a mother and father for each child who is born into a society. Now, however, many Westerners see marriage in primarily emotional terms.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Among other things, the danger with this mentality is that it fosters an anti-natalist mindset that fuels population decline, which in turn puts tremendous social, political, and economic strains on the larger society. Same-sex marriage would only further undercut the procreative norm long associated with marriage insofar as it establishes that there is no necessary link between procreation and marriage.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This was spelled out in the&nbsp;<em>Goodridge&nbsp;</em>decision in Massachusetts, where the majority opinion dismissed the procreative meaning of marriage. It is no accident that the countries that have legalized or are considering legalizing same-sex marriage have some of the lowest fertility rates in the world. For instance, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Canada have birthrates that hover around 1.6 children per woman--well below the replacement fertility rate of 2.1.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our high-quality writers are trained experts in custom essay writing.

People have to generally fail at something before they find success &ndash; even though failure can be defined as a lack of <a title=\"Ideas for Successful Collaboration\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/ideas-for-successful-collaboration\">success</a>, an unsuccessful person, enterprise or thing, a lack or deficiency of a desirable quality. But failure is not a means to an end, nor does failure have to give any indication of permanence. What is permanent is not getting started in the first place out of fear of failure. To fail is to fail to hit one&rsquo;s target, whatever it may be, but it doesn&rsquo;t prevent one from trying again.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A lot of times, a person fails because they failed to adequately prepare for success. This extends to all aspects of life that people want to <a title=\"4 Pillars of Successful Relationships\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-about-relationships-four-pillars-of-a-successful-relationship\">improve upon relationships</a>, career-related objectives, and personal achievements. Most people want to a better life, have goals and things they want to do in life. A good deal of time and effort go into preparing for something important &ndash; any important undertaking. It seems that many people pursue success half-heartedly, with little effort and preparation, and they wonder why the fail. Preparation is the key to avoiding failure, or it at the very least minimizes one&rsquo;s chances of failing. But it&rsquo;s not always a certainty.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Failure is Part of Success\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/quote-about-failure.jpg\" alt=\"Failure is not the opposite of success. It is part of success.\" width=\"650\" height=\"367\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To lessen the likelihood of failure, one has to do things to maximize their probability of success. This can be changing one&rsquo;s daily lifestyle habits, for one example. A person focused on accomplishing something, on creating success, will have to dedicate their free time to this cause. This means early nights and even earlier mornings, staying home and working instead of going out and spending money or wasting one&rsquo;s time. Failure can often be attributed to a lack of commitment to success. Everyone &ndash; well, perhaps most people &ndash; strive for success. People as a whole don&rsquo;t strive to fail at things in life. They generally want to excel at them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Lifestyle habits are important when considering their effect on failure, but one&rsquo;s mental habits are also a key part of success. A person convinced of their success, or that it will assuredly happen in the near future, will most likely be successful in life. They are seeing their success, what it looks and feels like, play out in their minds. This is the start of the Law of Attraction at work. The Law of Attraction is a theory arguing that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, a person can bring about positive or negative results. If a person yearns for success, thinks about it, dreams about it, always has their mind on it, the better their chances will be for them achieving success. This means they will be less likely to fail later.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Failure can also be prevented with the right kind of foresight. It is a highly discussed and much-believed notion that <a title=\"Custom Essay Writing\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/custom-essay\">a person&rsquo;s success</a> occurs in direct proportion to their ability to see how everything, every decision that is being made right now, affects their life down the road. People who are prone to failure live mostly for the day, or the next few days, and they neglect to consider the future &ndash; even the distant future. This is probably one of the strongest indicators of whether a person will fail or succeed in life.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Success &ndash; in whatever form &ndash; is not an easy thing to come about, to find. Rather it is created from lots of hard work, preparation, persistence and unrelenting confidence. Failure, on the other hand, results from a lack of these things. To conclude, failure is the absence of success, and failure is also not a means to an end, but an opportunity to learn from failure. Everybody fails at some point in their lives. What matters most is moving forward and never giving up on success. It will happen soon enough despite failure.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Need help with your essay? <a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/login\">Place an order</a> and you will see what academic success is.

In 2016, I plan on graduating with a degree in Marketing. This hasn&rsquo;t been an easy path, as I&rsquo;ve changed majors a couple times now &ndash; from English to Business to my current major. But one&rsquo;s twenties are meant to be a time of trying out different things and seeing what works, what doesn&rsquo;t, and what makes a person happy, healthy, successful and fulfilled.</p>\r\n<p>I was born in a small town just south of Richmond, Virginia, in the United States. My mother was a schoolteacher for one of the local schools. I believe she taught English and writing, but it all seems so vague now. Today, she is retired and tutors to keep busy. My dad, on the other hand, when I was I born was a journalist for the Richmond newspaper. Since then he has become a columnist for the same newspaper, but he is also an author. I am very proud to say that I come from a family of smart, happy, successful people who have always excelled at what they do.</p>\r\n<p>But there is more to me than my family. I am a person of my own experiences and dreams, hopes, and letdowns. I don&rsquo;t come from a wealthy family &ndash; in fact, we&rsquo;ve struggled financially over the years, just like other middle-class families. Nothing has ever been fed to me on a silver platter. Like my parents, I&rsquo;ve worked very hard, even at only 21 years old, for the things I&rsquo;ve accomplished in life. I&rsquo;m very proud of this fact.</p>\r\n<p>I am lucky in that my parents have taught me so much knowledge about the real world. Over the years they have helped me find people &ndash; friends and co-workers mostly &ndash; who would let me volunteer with them and learn about their job, doing short-served internships of sorts. Those experiences in high school and college have led me to my current course of study: Marketing. I have learned, from a very young and impressionable age, that our economic system is Capitalism: an economic and political system in which a country\'s trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state. Our country is run on the trading and selling of goods that are on a supply-and-demand basis, so it is important to market a product so that the public wants to buy and then does buy it. Marketing is ubiquitous and needed for every industry and market. Word-of-mouth advertising, of course, is effective, but it is nowhere near as helpful in turning profit as marketing.</p>\r\n<p>The term &ldquo;Marketing&rdquo; is indeed a vague one. It means advertising or promoting something, or as in offering for sale. It is done through advertisements on billboards, TV, radio, print publications, online publications, etc. Marketing is also done through the media &ndash; as in articles and stories about people, businesses, and products. When I graduate I will be prepared to start a career in the field, which will always be needed and adaptable to weak or strong economies. My focus will be in digital advertising as a way to market something. This involves many important and much-needed skills. Selling would involve superb language and communication skills, as well as superb interpersonal and listening skills. A salesman or saleswoman has to ease into learning of selling of their product or service, I&rsquo;ve learned. (In summer between semesters in college, I did a short stint selling advertisements in the community newspaper; it was a very helpful experience. I did well and made some spending money, but I also learned how to talk to people and sell.) Meeting with a potential client, on a sales call, is a lot like the hybrid of a job interview and auditioning for a role in a play. You need to know your lines, or at least be prepared to read aloud and use notes as a prompt. My goal is to own an advertising agency which will help big businesses, like Fortunate 500 businesses, market their products or services. I have a lot to learn, but I&rsquo;m certainly on my way to getting there.</p>','Essay About Yourself Sample: Adam Koontz Tells about Himself','','publish','closed','closed','','essay-about-yourself-example','','','2017-05-17 09:28:55','2017-05-17 06:28:55','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(376,1,'2015-11-17 17:57:13','2015-11-17 15:57:13','','essay-about-yourself3-v3','','inherit','closed','closed','','essay-about-yourself3-v3','','','2017-05-17 09:28:55','2017-05-17 06:28:55','',375,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/essay-about-yourself3-v3.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(377,1,'2015-11-27 18:14:53','2015-11-27 16:14:53','<p style=\"text-align: left;\">With season five of AMC&rsquo;s hit show The Walking Dead having concluded in the spring of 2015, one must reflect on how the zombie-horror genre has come to be so prominent in American popular culture. Not only has there been numerous films, novels, and television shows &ndash; both mainstream and underground &ndash; on the subject, there are even &ldquo;zombie-infested&rdquo; 5K&rsquo;s happening around the country and all around the world. Though The Walking Dead attracts millions of weekly viewers and will mostly likely be back for another season soon, most of the fans of the zombie-horror genre &ndash; besides the hardcore horror fanatics &ndash; probably don&rsquo;t know the true origin and history of the zombie legend.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Oxford English Dictionary states that the origin of the zombie myth can be traced back to West Africa. First recorded in the English language in 1819, the word &ldquo;zombie&rdquo; is the product of a Congo language, linguistically evolving from the Kikongo words &ldquo;zumbi&rdquo; (translated as &ldquo;fetish&rdquo;). &ldquo;Zombie&rdquo; was also originally used to reference a snake-god of the West African voodoo religion. &ldquo;When these peoples were taken as slaves to Haiti and other parts of the Caribbean during the 18th and early 19th centuries, they brought their religious beliefs and practices with them,&rdquo; (&ldquo;What is the origin&hellip;&rdquo;). UC Irvine professor Amy Wilentz believes the zombie genre to be a &ldquo;very logical offspring of New World slavery,&rdquo; (qt. in Gandhi). The institution of slavery in Haiti was so cruel, says Wilentz, that, to the slave, death was the only real escape.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Suicide was the slave\'s only way to take control over his or her own body ... And yet, the fear of becoming a zombie might stop them from doing so ... This final rest &mdash; in green, leafy, heavenly Africa, with no sugarcane to cut and no master to appease or serve &mdash; is unavailable to the zombie. To become a zombie was the slave\'s worst nightmare: to be dead and still a slave, an eternal field hand. (qt. in Gandhi.)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Zombies and slavery have been associated with one another in the United States since it first appeared in &ldquo;The Unknown Painter,&rdquo; a short story that was first published in the Chamber&rsquo;s Edinburgh Journal and subsequently reprinted in the American Alton Telegraph in 1838. The story, according to an essay on the evolution of the zombie in popular culture, was evidently popular among the American readers, with many different versions of the story printed in local newspapers across the country. Maximilian Schele de Vere, a linguistic scholar, would later define a zombie as \"a phantom or a ghost, not infrequently heard in the Southern States in nurseries and among the servants,\" (qt. in Gandhi).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In 1929, the word found its way into the American mainstream culture after author William Seabrook wrote a book, The Magic Island, about the voodoo worshippers he &ldquo;witnessed&rdquo; in Haiti &ndash; with numerous film scholars holding that White Zombie, a 1932 horror film, was based upon the work of Seabrook. George Romero&rsquo;s 1968 classic Night of the Living Dead is now considered a staple in the zombie-horror genre. Not only did it introduce zombie-horror to audiences worldwide, it became a social commentary on the racial tension of the 1960s in America as Romero cast Duane Jones, a black actor, as the film&rsquo;s hero.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This craze is certainly entering the mainstream, and to conclude, here is a perfect example of how it is becoming part of mainstream American society: Recently, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention attempted to exploit the zombie craze by publishing a page on their website concerned with &ldquo;zombie preparedness.&rdquo; Dr. Ali Khan, the Director of the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response, states, &ldquo;If you are generally well-equipped to deal with a zombie apocalypse, you will be prepared for a hurricane, pandemic, earthquake or terrorist attack,\" (qt. in Gandhi). Due to its popularity, the page crashed soon after posting, (Gandhi).</p>','Free Sample Essay About Zombies','','publish','closed','closed','','essay-about-zombies','','','2017-05-17 12:59:52','2017-05-17 09:59:52','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(378,1,'2015-11-27 18:14:53','2015-11-27 16:14:53','','free_sample_essay_about_zombies_ozessay','','inherit','closed','closed','','free_sample_essay_about_zombies_ozessay','','','2017-05-17 12:59:52','2017-05-17 09:59:52','',377,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/images/article/og/free_sample_essay_about_zombies_ozessay.jpg?v=1495701344',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(379,1,'2015-12-04 13:38:50','2015-12-04 11:38:50','<p dir=\"rtl\">?? ????? ????? ?? ??????? ???? ?? ?????? ????? ?? ??????? ????????. ????? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ?? ?????? ?? ???? ?????. ???? ????? ?? ???? ?? ??? ?? ???????? ?? ???? ??????? ?? ??? ???????? ????. ??? ?? ???? ????? ?????? ??? ?? ???? ????? ???? ???? ???????. ????? ?????? ????? ????? ???? ??????? ???? ??????.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"rtl\">?? ?? ????? ?????</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"rtl\">??? ????? ???? ???? ??????? ????? ????? ?? ???? ???? ???? ?? ??????? ??? ???? ?? ????? ?? ??? ?? ???? ????? ??????. ??? ????? ??????? ???? ???? ?????? ?????.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"rtl\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"rtl\">??????? ?????????? ?? ???? ?????? ???? ??? ???? ?????? ????? ?? ?????? ?????. ????? ?? ???? ???? ?????? ????. ??? ???? ?????? ???? ????? ?? ????? ?? ?????? ??????? ?? ?????. ?? ????? ??? ??? ????. ?????? ?????? ????? ?? ?? ???? ????? ????? ????? ???? ???? ???? ????.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"rtl\">???? ?????? ???????? ????????? ?????</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"rtl\">??? ????? ?????? ???????? ?????? ?? ??????? ??????? ????? ???? ?????? ????? ?? ?????? ????? ?? ????? ???? ???????. ??? ???? ?? ??????? ?????? ??? ???? ?? ??????? ??? ?? ???? ???. ??? ????? ???? ???? ????? ??????.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"rtl\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"rtl\">??????? ?????? ??? ?? ??? ??????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????? ????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ?????. ?? ???? ????? ???? ?? ???. ??? ??? ?? ??? ?????? ???? ????? ???? ????? ??? ?? ???????? ?? ???? ????? ?????? ???. ????? ??? 10 ???????? ???????:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"rtl\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul dir=\"rtl\">\r\n<li>????? ??????????</li>\r\n<li>???? ?????</li>\r\n<li>???????</li>\r\n<li>???? ?????? ???</li>\r\n<li>???</li>\r\n<li>??????? ?? ????? ?????</li>\r\n<li>??????? ???????</li>\r\n<li>??? ??????</li>\r\n<li>??? ?? ??????</li>\r\n<li>??????????? ?? ??????? - ???? ?? ????</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir=\"rtl\">????? ????? ????????</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"rtl\">?? ????? ?? ???? ????? ??? ????? ??????. ???? ???????? ??? ?? ????. ??????? ?? ????? ????? ????? ??. ??? ????? ??????. ??????? ?? ??? ????? ????????? ???? ???? ??????. ??? ?? ?????? ?? ?????.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"rtl\">?????? ???? ???? ???????</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"rtl\">???? ???? ??????? ??????? ????? ???? ?? ??? ????? ???? ??????. ???? 4 ??? ???? ?? ???? ???????: ????? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ????? ??? ??????? ??????????. ??? ????? ?? ???? ???? ??? ????? ????????? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? ????? ?????.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"rtl\">????? ?????????</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"rtl\">????? ??????? ?? ?????. ??? ?? ????? ?? ?? ????? ???? ???? ?? ???? ??????? ?????? ???????? ??? ?? ??? ???? ??????. ?????? ?? ????? ????? ????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??? ??????? ?????? ??????.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"rtl\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"rtl\">???? ??? ???? ???? ?????? ?? ??? ??????. ????? ?? ??? ????? ?? ??????? ???? ??? ????? ?? ?? ?? ?????. ????? ?????? ????? ?? ?? ????? ?????? ????????? ?????? ?? ????? ?? ??? ???? ??? ?? ???? ?? ????.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"rtl\">?????? ??????????

He believed that permanence is an illusion and that everything lives in a process of constant change.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Think about it &ndash; change is seen in the natural world&rsquo;s transformations as well as its transition from season to season; change occurs among people who transform &ndash; both physically, mentally, socially, emotionally and even spiritually &ndash; every single day of their lives; and change is seen in civilization, politics, thought, art, geography and economy, etc., in just about every aspect of the modern world. The word &ldquo;Change&rdquo; refers to an act or instance of making or becoming different &ndash; such as history&rsquo;s change, or transition, from a nomadic to an agricultural society.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If this notion is valid, then why does it seem that so many people are resistant to change? It&rsquo;s a tough question to answer. But it warrants an attempt.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Consider all the changes in a person&rsquo;s life: a person is born a small baby, they live and grow, then one day become old and decrepit, and they ultimately die. It is the natural order of things, but no one wants to get old, suffer and die. So naturally, people do things to resist this big change, only to finally come to terms that they &ndash; like all living things &ndash; must wither away into a state of nothingness.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">People willingly and deliberately do things to go against the grain of aging, such as avoiding unhealthy lifestyle choices, like sleeping too little, eating unhealthy foods, smoking, drinking too much alcohol, and stressing too much too often. They think they can avoid the inevitable if they just try hard enough, though this mentality is just a distraction from dying and death itself. People get plastic surgery in order to convince themselves they are further away from old age and death than they actually are.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But avoiding the natural changes of life only adds more suffering, creating a deep feeling that one is not being true to themselves and not living according to the natural order of the world. This, in turn, creates inner turmoil, as their resistance to change does more harm than good.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Nonetheless, people are against this &ndash; as Humanity as a whole is once again resistant to change. Had he been wiser, Heraclitus would have said, &ldquo;the resistance to change is the only constant in life.&rdquo; But there was no way he could have anticipated the complex world in which we live today, with its never-ending influx of new technologies that change the way we all live, think, work and relate to people.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Perhaps people are afraid of change and its implications for good reasons. People work hard in their lives, both professional and personal, to get the hang of it &ndash; to figure it out. Then comes along a big change, a departure from what was previously seen and understood as normal, and it&rsquo;s hard to accept. Change makes for new challenges, for different ways of doing things, and it creates a disruption of the normal way of living for most people. To conclude, it seems logical that a person can avoid much suffering in life if they take on a perspective that includes accepting change &ndash; and just going with the flow of life. It&rsquo;s better that way. It has to be. Change is the only constant in life.

Carr argues that what makes us intelligent is not just finding the information quickly but the ability to think deeply about the information. Deep thinking required in this case can only be attained if one&rsquo;s mind is calm and attentive. The higher the level of concentration leads to richer thoughts. In case of a distraction such as the use of the Internet through computers and phone, it becomes hard to understand and remember. &nbsp;According to the article, Google leads to superficial thinking making the users shallow. Although one can Google all the fact that they want, it is hard to Google one\'s way to brilliance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">&ldquo;Google effect&rdquo; can be defined as the digital amnesia. This is a tendency to forget the information which is easily found online using Google. According to study, people are less likely to remember the details which they believe are highly likely to be accessed online. People fail to attempt in storing information in their memory since they know they can always access it online at the click of a button. According to Carr, humans&nbsp;are not forming the required rich connections in their minds due to Google effects. This is due to fact that memory consolidation requires attentiveness which helps in forming connections. This is not given by google. Combinations of &lsquo;Google effect&rsquo; and distraction coming from the smartphones have led to a reduced attention span.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Having information at our fingertips has led to the reduction in concentration and contemplation. The information is just a click away and we can move from tab to tab. In fact, the ease of availability of information has made it hard to form connections in our mind. We have failed in creating knowledge due to lack of attentiveness. The cognitive and emotional aspects of human beings have been eroded by Google availing information on our fingertips. This has reduced the level of innovation and creativity among the Internet users. Availability of information online has led to laziness in reasoning since the information is easily available at the click of a button.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Carr makes a connection between the Internet and our mental activity as well as the brain structure. Our brain never stops learning from the impact of the Internet. In fact, technology does not only change the manner in which we think but also changes the structure of the brains. Thus, the Internet has turned out to be the global prosthesis of our collective memory. Based on the modern neuroscience, our habitual practices have the ability to change our own neuronal structures. Our addiction of using the Internet technology has the capability to change and shape our brains. Moreover, the brain neural circuitry changes based on experience hence can be changed through the impacts of web technologies. The computer software has the impact on cognition leading to weakening of concentration and contemplation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">I highly support the use of Google. Google is an important tool and I feel that it helps a lot in finding information in a fast and timely manner. Despite this, I feel that Google can make one stupid based on the way in which they use it. People who misuse Google are the one who are impacted in a negative way. For example, searching for things with direct answers leads to enhancing stupidity. In fact, most people do not take time to reflect and analyze the information provided by the search engine whether it is true or not. &nbsp;Google helps through providing information that we need. Thus, Google helps us in our everyday lives making it possible to have all information at our fingertips. In addition, Google helps in restructuring our minds to view intelligence in new ways. It has helped a lot in removing barriers to accessing information. Through democratizing access to information, it leads to better collaboration, inclusivity, and diversity helping in creating valuable information. It is thus unfair to fully blame the stupidity of humans to the search engine. The main problem is the human beings becoming highly dependent on the search engine and failing to allow our brains to develop the way it is supposed to. Google is an efficient tool for searching for information and hence cannot be the only blame for human race stupidity. Human beings have to embrace the modern ways of obtaining information while at the same making sure that the means do not compromise their mental abilities.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/persuasive-writing-topics\">BEST PERSUASIVE ESSAY TOPICS IN 2017</a></strong></h4>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Persuasive Writing Example: Are <strong>Parents</strong> Good Teachers?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/persuasive-essay-example1.jpg\" alt=\"Persuasive Essay Example1\" width=\"750\" height=\"374\" /></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Parental influence tends to be of great benefit to children and more so during their early years and as they school. Of all the individuals involved in the upbringing of the child, parents are the most influential ones. A parent may not know but their daily behaviors ranging from the manner in which they live, the tone they use usually influences the manner in which their children will act in the future.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Students who have parents tend to be more involved in their school and they also have fewer behavioral problems. Their academic performance is better as compared to the students whose parents are absent. The positivity of parents&rsquo; influence can usually be demonstrated during the elementary and secondary levels. Based on the available research, when parents are more involved in the school life, their children are likely to have a strong performance since they are likely to identify areas that they are failing and make rectifications in time and work collaboratively with teachers in encouraging the most acceptable classroom behavior.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">This seemed to be a similar case to me when, during my first year in high school, my parents were never involved in my school life and my grades were poor. However, the situation changed when they became concerned and more involved in my school life. In respect to these, my parents and teachers were able to identify at an appropriate time the various problems that were inhibiting my learning and the issues were resolved on time. Therefore, parents should always ensure that they have a positive influence on their children.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">One of the best ways in which parents can educate their children is by acting as their teachers as well as the most effective role model and by doing so; the children learn the various skills that they need. Some of the skills that the children learn are the basic household tasks and handling of more complex responsibilities. When parents take their role seriously, they lay the groundwork for the children and in respect to these; the children will have what is needed and know what is needed for them to develop into responsible and independent adults.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Another way in which the parents educate their children is by modeling appropriate behaviors. The manner in which parents behave and act has a great influence on how their children act in future. For example, my parent&rsquo;s responsible nature molded me to be responsible like they.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Parents have a role to play in their children&rsquo;s life and in relation to these, there are lessons that they should teach their kids. One major lesson&nbsp;that they should teach their kids is treating others with respect at all times and this plays an essential role in limiting conflicts among people since respect for the authority shows obedience, respect for oneself usually shows self-worth and self-control. I acquired this skill at an early age and still ensure that I follow it in my everyday activities.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Another lesson that parents should teach their kids is manners. This is because manners are said to raise a kid&rsquo;s social IQ and it also makes them into being reasonable and thoughtful people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The debate on whether parents are good teachers or not seems not to be ending soon since those against the arguments and those that are for it have strong contributions as well as influence. There are aspects that we learn from our parents that tend to be more important than what we learn from the teachers despite the long years of academic learning. From our parents, we learn how best to talk, survive, and distinguish what is right and wrong, morality and life values. My parents taught me how to survive on my own at an early age. Even though they offered the required support, there were times where I was required to tackle an issue on my own. In most instances, children are usually a true reflection of their parents and their characters are usually shaped by their parent&rsquo;s behavior and personality.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/persuasive-essay-writing-service\">PERSUASIVE ESSAY WRITING SERVICE</a></h4>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Are you struggling with your persuasive essay sample?

These extensive files are full of incriminating evidence that is going to be used against the wealthy individuals who have managed to hide billions and billions of dollars from governments all around the world. The offshore financial leak demonstrates that the corruption of the offshore financial industry runs much deeper than even the most cynical people could possibly have imagined.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The People Named in the Panama Papers</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The list of names for the people involved in the scandal is still in the process of being completed. There is a lot of data to analyze. It is also true that some of the people involved were the family members of wealthy and prominent individuals, and it remains to be seen whether they were acting alone or whether their powerful and wealthy family members were involved.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some people have asked why so few of the names have been American, and it is possible that this is simply because the investigation has yet to uncover absolutely everyone who is involved with a scandal that is this large.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As yet, the leaders of the Ukraine, Argentina, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Iceland, and the United Kingdom have all been implicated. The family of the president of Azerbaijan has been implicated as well. However, celebrities, professional athletes, drug traffickers, and billionaires in various disciplines have all been implicated, and journalists are still reviewing the data in order to uncover more people. There are hundreds of individuals who have not been identified yet, if not more.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Jacki Chan and Lionel Messi have joined the ranks of entertainers who are potentially among the guilty parties. It remains to be seen how many more famous people will turn out to have been involved in this enormous corruption scandal.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Mossack Fonseca and the Corruption Scandal</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Using the services of the law firm Mossack Fonseca, the various wealthy clients all around the world established offshore shell companies for the sake of tax evasion. They were able to avoid getting their enormous fortunes taxed to the degree that they should have been, and all of the wealthy people who were implicated by the Panama Papers are all going to have to be both individually and collectively investigated.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This law firm has done everything from changing the dates on documents to covering up the incriminating documents that have been attributed to their clients. They have tried to keep their clients safe in every way. It turns out that they have ultimately failed to do so in the most dramatic way imaginable.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The International Response to the Panama Papers</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is important to note that as of April 2016, people have still not entirely completed the enormous investigation into a scandal that is this large and that has managed to involve so many powerful individuals. In all likelihood, it is going to take months just to nail down all of the facts. Teams of journalists all over the world are working together in order to make sure that they are able to name all of the people who have been involved in the Panama Papers scandal.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Not all of the clients of the Mossack Fonseca law firm were implicated in the crimes, since this is a law firm that has probably done some legitimate work. However, almost all of their clients are automatically going to be under suspicion at the moment as a result of what this law firm and financial services provider has been willing to do for forces that are so powerful and so corrupt.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There have already been arrests made in Brazil, including to some very powerful political figures. Germany and other countries are launching their own investigations. Journalists are still trying to get down all of the facts, which is going to help law enforcement officials when it comes to determining who is guilty and how much money they are going to have to return to their respective governments. Many of these people are going to do jail time&nbsp;since tax evasion is a tremendously serious offense. Some of the guilty parties are guilty of crimes that extend beyond tax evasion, so it remains to be seen exactly how these people are going to be punished by their own countries and by the international community at large.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Panama Papers scandal has set an important precedent for the twenty-first century and the fact that it is going to be harder and harder to succeed at pulling off conspiracies like this in the Information Age.</p>','Panama Papers','','publish','closed','closed','','panama-papers','','','2017-05-17 11:42:03','2017-05-17 08:42:03','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(438,1,'2016-04-06 18:18:03','2016-04-06 15:18:03','','panama-papers2-v1','','inherit','closed','closed','','panama-papers2-v1','','','2017-05-17 11:42:03','2017-05-17 08:42:03','',437,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/panama-papers2-v1.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(439,1,'2017-03-14 11:10:29','2017-03-14 09:10:29','<p>Buying essays and other academic papers online has become an increasingly acceptable action by students all over the globe, but trying to find a reputable source of essays online to buy is a dangerous game in some respects.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/write-my-college-essay\">WRITE MY COLLEGE ESSAY: USING A WRITING SERVICE</a></h4>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>There are many different sources of writing for hire, but how can you verify that the work is authentic, original and not copied from somewhere else? Eventually, you just have to ask, is it safe to <a title=\"Buy Essay Online!\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/buy-essay\">buy essays online</a>?</p>\r\n<h2>The Considerations</h2>\r\n<p>Several factors have to be considered to answer this question, about whether or not it\'s safe to buy cheap essays online. Does the Source Appear to be Reputable? While it\'s impossible to tell just by feeling out the situation, there are some red flags associated with some sources offering essays to buy at a low price online:</p>\r\n<h3>Do they have their essays pre-written?</h3>\r\n<p>Usually, when a source offers the opportunity to buy academic writing that\'s already written, it\'s because that paper has been used already. At best, you\'ll turn in work that isn\'t original and tailored to your assignment, and at worst, you\'ll be penalized for plagiarism.</p>\r\n<h3>Do they offer a quality guarantee?</h3>\r\n<p>If not, it\'s a real gamble on the final product. Reputable companies have a team of writers with expertise on your topic and work with you throughout the process of writing so that their essays to buy online are tailored to <a title=\"Paid Assignment Writing\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/paid-assignment-writing\">your assignment</a> and come out just the way you want them.</p>\r\n<h3>Does their site look professional?</h3>\r\n<p>When you buy cheap essays online, you want to have the peace of mind that comes with a polished business with a strong presentation and simple ordering platform. An up-front price grid and quick, free estimates are all part of the recipe of finding a company who won\'t give you low-quality work or plagiarized essays.</p>\r\n<h2>The Keys to Finding Out Where to Buy Essays Online</h2>\r\n<p>The answer to your question is this: <strong>yes, it\'s safe to buy essays online</strong>, but only if you know where to buy from. If you buy essays online from anywhere and just assume it\'ll work out, it may not. Here\'s how to make sure you\'re buying from the right sources.</p>\r\n<h3>They Write Custom Papers at All Levels</h3>\r\n<p>A safe source of essays to buy online doesn\'t just have the ability to write at one level, or on one topic, and you\'re wasting money and putting yourself at risk by trusting someone like this.</p>\r\n<p>A reputable seller of writing online has writers with experience writing various different types of essays, from a simple reflective essay to a complex and lengthy law school case study.</p>\r\n<h3>They Offer Free Estimates and Price Quotes for a Variety of Services</h3>\r\n<p>A shady, unsafe source of online essays typically won\'t give you a price estimate until after you agree on their services. This can lead to you spending more money on an inferior product. A safe, reputable company will show you their prices ahead of time, broken down into writing level and whether or not you elect to have the work proofread and edited.</p>\r\n<p>When answering the question, is it safe to buy essays online?, you have to find a company that checks all these boxes before you know you can get quality work at a low price.

An example is an argumentative essay. An argumentative essay is one where a student has to meet certain expectations. The student is supposed to investigate, collect and generate information relating to a topic. They should also get evidence and establish a certain position that can be explained in a certain manner. Argumentative essays require extensive research to be conducted, and the arguments in the essay must be reasonable.

They have the following elements in them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">1. A clear introduction to the thesis. The author should explain the subject matter of the topic in general terms. They should also enlighten the reader as to why they should care about the topic.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">2. The introduction is followed by paragraphs that comprise the body. The body contains additional information that will support the argument. Each paragraph is a representation of a given idea. The information contained in the body of the essay should be well researched. The information should be current, and the sources should be well recognized.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">3. Even when giving information that supports the argument, a good essay will also accommodate a few of the conflicting opinions. However, the opposing views concerning the debate should not be more than those for the argument. The main ones should be the ones mentioned and explanation given for the same.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">4. There must be a conclusion that is a summary of the entire argument. The conclusion should give the reader a reason to support the argument presented. From the conclusion, a reader should understand why the argument presented is considered to be the best on that topic.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The common argumentative essay outline is known <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Five Paragraph Essay\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/five-paragraph-essay\">as a five paragraph essay</a>. The five paragraphs are subdivided as follows:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">a) The introductory paragraph</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">b) Three body paragraphs. They include views from the proposing and opposing side.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">c) A definite conclusion is summarizing the entire topic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Argumentative Essay Themes and Ideas</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Not every issue can be argued in an essay. There are topics that will not have the necessary supporting factors that are required in an argumentative essay. There are some topics that are popular for argumentative essays.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When choosing argumentative essays, one should choose a topic that matters to them and is an issue in the public eye. They will focus more on getting information to support their opinions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">These include the following:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li><em>Human and animal testing</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Capital punishment</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Security cameras and right to privacy</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Homeschooling</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Retirement age</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Government policies</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Family planning and abortion</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;ts of Argumentative Essay Writing</h2>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Do&rsquo;s</h3>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li><em>Support your opinion with accurate facts and opinions from relevant sources.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Write on a topic that the audience will enjoy reading.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Give examples and have an interesting introduction that will capture the mind of your audience.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Ensure your work is well organized.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Familiarize with possible objections and find ways of addressing them in the essay.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Use &lsquo;we&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;I&rsquo; as it makes people feel like they are being represented in the argument.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Have a strong conclusion that will draw them to agree with and support your position.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Don&rsquo;ts</h3>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li><em>Do not start the essay with negative remarks as this will put the audience off.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Do not threaten the audience since you will lose their support.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>When making arguments, do not use the either/or approach.

A creative brief is a document created within a few meeting between a brand client and their advertising agency of choice. The meetings outline a plan for an original campaign to push a product or message out into the public, and the creative brief is the culmination of the decisions made in those meetings, along with some creative direction from the person heading the team &mdash; usually the Creative Director. The brief fleshes out all of the ideas but does so without focusing too much on the logistics of the ideas.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Creative Brief Types</h3>\r\n<ol style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>The creative brief</strong></em> outlines the information and objectives to inspire the creative idea.</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>The communications brief</strong></em> summarizes the current state of the consumer and spells out how to improve upon this state with the client\'s products or services.</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>The manifesto</strong></em> is both a written and a visual statement used to help internal and external audiences understand the brand.

There may be other members that make up the core group, and they will also contribute, but the essential ingredients are a visual person, a writer, and an overseer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The document lets the client know that the agency has heard their \"pains\" and not only do they understand how the client wants to carry out their campaign but they know how to elevate those initial criteria without disrupting the message or budget.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The final document gets presented after a short period has elapsed following the last idea meeting. The turnaround is usually tight, and that\'s sometimes why additional help is needed &mdash; maybe by a creative brief writing company &mdash; to make sure it is put together in time.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">5 Steps to Writing an Excellent Creative Brief</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 1:</strong> <em><strong>Dissect the problem you are trying to solve and decide on the products \"noble purpose.\"</strong></em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Get to know the point of pain that the product or service addresses and who is most likely to feel that pain enough to purchase something to solve it. Look at what their options are now and how the option in question differs from the rest. Ask: what can you use to leverage this product\'s differences for the benefit of the end user. Furthermore, ask how you can communicate those differences in the most appealing way.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 2:</strong> <em><strong>Gather insights, data, sources, and case studies.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The creative brief must be visionary and backed up with solid findings to help the client see why the solution being proposed is undeniably viable.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 3:<em> Determine what should be said and how it should be said.</em></strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">In this step, you are deciding on the message and the medium. While the actual vehicle &mdash; television, radio, social media &mdash; may have already been chosen, you can make further decisions like the time of day the campaign will air, the countries where it will be distributed, and how to integrate it with mobile technology.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 4:</strong> <em><strong>Write, write, write. And then discuss with the team and revise.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Make sure you have all of the essential touchstones for the creative brief listed in the following section and review. The writing is the hardest part, but it\'s where all the magic happens.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Step 5:</strong> <em><strong>Format the creative brief.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Use some images that help illustrate the ideas you are putting forward.

Having done this they are in a position to choose a position and support it with evidence collected. To get a convincing essay one can consider hiring essay writing service.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The common argumentative essay outline is known&nbsp;<strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" title=\"Five Paragraph Essay\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/five-paragraph-essay\">as a five paragraph essay</a></strong>.&nbsp;The essay will consist of:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A<em>n introductory paragraph</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Three evidentiary body paragraphs</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>A conclusion</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is basically the outline of the essay. Each of the sections will require some very important elements.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Introductory Paragraph</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is the paragraph in which you lay down the foundation of your argument. In this paragraph there is the hook, the background information and the thesis statement.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The hook is the first sentence and it is meant to grab the attention of the reader. The next section of the introduction should be dedicated to giving information about the background information on the topic. You can first decide to define the key terms of the argument. Some questions that you could ask yourself to get the context include; what is the issue at hand? Why is it important? Who cares? The next section in the introductory paragraph is the thesis. Thesis is a general statement about the main idea. The thesis statement should establish a clear position that you will later support. A thesis statement should be concise and specific. It should not provide too much information. It should match the requirements of the assignment at hand. It should be easily recognizable and should be supported by data and good reasoning.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Evidentiary Body Paragraphs</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This section a can further is divided into two parts. The two parts are Paragraphs that develop your argument and a paragraph that refutes the opponent\'s arguments.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Paragraphs containing your argument</em></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is the section where you introduce your claims and each of the claims has to be backed by evidence. You must be in a position to develop your claim in a thorough manner as possible. A claim is a statement that is made in order to support your argument. You can have two paragraphs in this section. Each paragraph should explore a distinct idea that will support your thesis. For each claim made, the student should be in a position to provide supporting evidence. The evidence given has to be factual and it must be from reliable sources. To get accurate evidence you can order argumentative essay. It should not be personal knowledge. For each claim try as much as possible to give at least three pieces of claims. There are some claims that might not have that number of evidence, so it is not limited to three pieces of evidence the number does not matter. To make the claim believable you need to use as much evidence as you can.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Refuting opponents\' arguments</em></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is the section that comes just after you have given enough evidence to support the claims. So as to present a convincing as fair message you must anticipate, and research as well as outline some of the common arguments that will dispute the student\'s thesis. It is important to consider the other positions for those reading your essay yet they have not decided which side of the argument they should support. It is wise to get organized before you can write this paragraph. You can forecast all the information and then address each of the points as you proceed. When you refute an opposing position it is wise to organize it in three parts. The opponents\' argument &ndash; at the beginning of the paragraph you just state the main point that you wish to refute as accurately and fairly as possible.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">1. The opponents\' argument &ndash; at the beginning of the paragraph you just state the main point that you wish to refute as accurately and fairly as possible.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">2. The students\' position &ndash; you must make clear the nature of your disagreements with the position you are refuting.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">3. The refutation &ndash; the nature of your disagreement will dictate the specifics of your counter argument.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva;\">Conclusion</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This part of the essay wraps up all what you have been discussing. This is the part of the essay that will leave the most immediate impression on the reader. For these reason it has to be effective and logical. The conclusion should begin by generally stating the main points of your argument and state why it is important. You must restate your thesis. You address the opposing viewpoints and explain why readers should align with your position. After this paragraph you are finished and you must not bring in any new points. You might want to add in a discussion encouraging more research. When writing, remember that simplicity is the best option for a clear and convincing message.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Let our experts do the work</strong>.

This type of essay is meant to persuade the reader that a certain idea is correct - and it should do so using logic and reason. The goal of persuasive articles is <strong>to make the reader accept your point of view</strong> and to show that the author is able to back up his/her opinion. It must contain clear evidence and logical reasoning, which can be achieved by using various examples, solid reasoning, sufficient &amp; relevant information as well as experts&rsquo; quotes and opinions. A quality essay requires a lot of research and planning, so do not rush it.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/persuasive-writing-topics\">150 MOST POPULAR PERSUASIVE ESSAY TOPICS</a></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Just in case you do not feel confident about writing a persuasive essay or persuasive language you can always ask an experienced professional writer for some help. You can work out the topic together and cooperate to write a paper that totally reflects your opinion, - nothing wrong with asking for help.</p>\r\n<h2>Persuasive Essay Draft</h2>\r\n<p>It actually starts with a persuasive essay outline. The structure of the outline for persuasive essay writing is critical, therefore it is important to make sure you really stick to it. Your essay should consist of at least 5 paragraphs and a conclusion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>1. Introductory Paragraph</h3>\r\n<p>Use the first persuasive paragraph to clearly state your opinion on the subject matter. This way you will be able to grasp reader&rsquo;s attention right from the start. Don&rsquo;t forget to make your position on the subject matter bright and clear. This is called your topic sentence (or your thesis); it&rsquo;s the stance you are taking and will be defending in your essay. Once you state your position stick to it throughout the paper. Last but not the least for this paragraph you need to substantiate your claim and present your facts &amp; findings.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Body Paragraphs</h3>\r\n<p>There are clear rules for writing the second paragraph in your persuasive writing template. Think of all the facts that you want to use as a&nbsp;backup for your claim, then come up with the main one that has the most persuasive power. You need to, first of all, give your main reason and explain why others should adopt your opinion. Once you have stated that reason,&nbsp;add three more details to it. Explain those additional reasons in your third and fourth paragraph (that makes paragraph 3 and paragraph 4, respectively).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Use paragraph five to give your reasoning as to why the other side is wrong. In order to prove that the other side is actually wrong, you need to give two or three details in support of your opinion. This is another technique to demonstrate that your opinion is correct. Notice that when teaching persuasive essay writing some tutors might forget to mention that it is important to mention the opposing opinion and then tackle it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>3. The Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Paragraph six is the final paragraph and it should be your conclusion. Use this part of your essay to reiterate what you expressed in the first paragraph. Also, you want to add a summary of all the main ideas you have put in the essay above. You have to repeat the points you&rsquo;ve made to capture your reader&rsquo;s attention and make sure the essay stays in his/her memory.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/how-to-write-a-persuasive-essay\">HOW TO WRITE YOUR PERSUASIVE ESSAY</a></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Persuasive Essay Layout &nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>Persuasive text should follow a strict structure. First of all, you always need to have an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. It might sound complicated at first but once you get the idea things will get clearer. Once you submit the final paper other students might disagree with your idea or come up with an essay protecting the opposing ideas - go ahead and tackle the opposing views.</p>\r\n<p>Also, do not hesitate to ask for professional help. If you&rsquo;re still not sure what persuasive writing is, read on. Your introduction should contain something to grasp your reader&rsquo;s attention right away, it has to be catchy and easy to understand. You need to make your thesis statement. It should be complete and powerful as your sole purpose is to influence the reader into accepting your point of view. The body of your essay should consist of ironclad reasoning for your opinion.</p>\r\n<p>This contradiction will help you to persuade the reader and have him/her accept your idea in the end. Summarize all the main ideas of your essay in your conclusion.</p>\r\n<blockquote>One of the main persuasive writing ideas is to answer the &ldquo;So what?&rdquo; question. This way you can actually make the reader feel like accepting your point of view and look at things differently.</blockquote>\r\n<h2>Themes and Topics for Your Persuasive Essay</h2>\r\n<p>It is very helpful to have some ideas or topics for persuasive writing before getting down to it. Among the numerous ideas that come to mind contemplate over the following topics:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Should men and women have the same payment for the same amount of work?</li>\r\n<li>Should the government bring back the death penalty as the capital punishment?</li>\r\n<li>Should the USA have free healthcare for everyone?</li>\r\n<li>Should the schools in the&nbsp;USA have a&nbsp;compulsory uniform for everyone?</li>\r\n<li>Should the USA adopt an open border policy and provide all migrants with Green Cards?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Of course, these are just some interesting and controversial topics for your own persuasive writing activities and inspiration. But now you can think on those subjects and come up with a creative idea of your own.</p>\r\n<h2>Persuasive Essay Writing Guidelines</h2>\r\n<p>The outline and the template are not enough to help you create a perfect essay.

Show up to class&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The first habit of highly successful college students is very obvious.&nbsp; They show up to class.&nbsp; Professors take attendance, and absences can negatively influence a student\'s participation grade.&nbsp; While college teachers do appreciate their paychecks, they often become teachers because they have a passion for the material.&nbsp; Students who do not show up to class are implying that they do not care what the teacher has to say about the given material.&nbsp; Teachers are normal people who like to be appreciated and resent when they are not.&nbsp; Additionally, any information covered while the student was absent that appears on tests will undoubtedly be a source of consternation and incorrect answers for that student.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Take notes in class&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The second obvious habit of highly successful college students is that they take notes in class.&nbsp; While everyone would like to have a memory that retained everything they wished it would, studies show that people retain less than half of what they hear.&nbsp; Taking notes makes the student listener a more active participant in the lectures they hear.&nbsp; The action of taking notes also forces the student to follow the logical track that the teacher is following.&nbsp; Teachers are paid to write lesson plans that disseminate information in a logical, organized fashion.&nbsp; Notes on a lecture should in some form resemble the lesson plans of the teacher.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">3. Do the assigned homework&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Yet another obvious habit of successful college students is that they do the assigned homework.&nbsp; Homework can be time-consuming and tedious, but if a student wishes to do well in a class and understand where the teacher is leading them, then they need to complete the homework that the teacher assigns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">While these first three habits are rather obvious, the following four habits of highly successful college students are more subtle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">4. Sit in the front row&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The college classroom can be an environment rife with distractions.&nbsp; From students browsing Facebook on their laptops to students talking to each other while the teacher is lecturing, it can be difficult to concentrate on what the instructor is saying.&nbsp; Habit four of highly successful college students is that when possible they sit in the front row.&nbsp; Invariably those who sit in the front row achieve better grades and are more engaged in the classroom than those who sit in the back of the class.&nbsp; This holds true for most grade levels, but especially in college where students are expected to hold themselves accountable.&nbsp; If your goal is to graduate with a stellar GPA then you will want to place yourself physically in a position in each class that eliminates as many distractions as possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">5. Be active participant in your classes</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Piggybacking on the previous recommendation to utilize seating arrangements for more engagement in the classroom, habit five of highly successful college students is that they force themselves to be active participants in their classes.&nbsp; Potential for embarrassment at having said the wrong thing is a great motivator for taking the time to come to class prepared and well-informed.&nbsp; By forcing themselves to share their opinions and answer questions in front of their peers, highly successful college students provide themselves with additional motivation for completing their assignments.&nbsp; An aspect of active participation that works in the favor of highly successful college students is that their participation is appreciated by their teachers.&nbsp; Teachers cover the same material semester-after-semester, or quarter-after-quarter, and appreciate when someone else is willing to break the monotony of that cycle by sharing what may be a fresh opinion.&nbsp; Additionally, participation shows interest, and there are few things more important to teachers than that their students show some interest in the material.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">6. Stay after class and talk to teachers about the material</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Habit five builds good will between professor and student, and habit six of highly successful college students advocates further developing this relationship.&nbsp; The age-old image of a student bringing a shiny red apple to their teacher still applies, but in college the apple is of a different nature.&nbsp; Students who do well in their classes stay after class and talk to teachers about the material.&nbsp; They make queries looking for clarification.&nbsp; Again, the grade a student receives can be directly linked not only to their performance in the class but also to the level of interest they demonstrate in the material.&nbsp; College teachers spend at least six years of their lives acquiring the necessary degrees to be afforded the opportunity to stand in front of a classroom and discuss the subjects that they find interesting.&nbsp; Although teachers are incredibly busy and have tight schedules, they are always appreciative of students who demonstrate an interest in drawing upon the knowledge that they have accumulated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">7. Remember&nbsp;you are working for your future</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The final habit of highly successful college students is not a practice but a frame of mind.&nbsp; College workloads can be overwhelming, and sometimes it can be difficult to envision the payoff for all of your hard work.&nbsp; Students who do well regularly remind themselves that they are working for their future.&nbsp; They see college as a worthwhile investment of their time and energy.&nbsp; They refuse to believe that the reward upon completion of their education will be anything but what they are hoping for.&nbsp; Keeping this sense in their mind, they are able to overcome any and all roadblocks that may present themselves along the way and are able to not only complete their education but distinguish themselves while doing so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Completing college takes a great deal of time and money.&nbsp; It makes sense, therefore, to do well and make the process as simple as possible.&nbsp; By utilizing these seven simple steps, virtually anyone should be able to perform well in college and get the grades that they feel they deserve.</p>','Seven Habits of Highly Successful College Students ','','publish','closed','closed','','seven-habits','','','2017-05-17 11:29:28','2017-05-17 08:29:28','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(450,1,'2016-04-28 15:09:22','2016-04-28 12:09:22','','habits_of_successful_students_ozessay','','inherit','closed','closed','','habits_of_successful_students_ozessay','','','2017-05-17 11:29:28','2017-05-17 08:29:28','',449,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/images/article/og/habits_of_successful_students_ozessay.jpg?v=1495608405',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(451,1,'2016-11-25 12:42:13','2016-11-25 10:42:13','<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">INDIGENOUS HEALTH ESSENTIALS</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though there have been improvements in the wellbeing and overall health of the aboriginal Australians in recent years, there are still some longstanding challenges. In fact, organizations such as Kalinda, an inaugural Wingara Mura Leadership Program Fellow, launched in 2016 continues to survey new ways to deal with the disparities in health outcomes for Indigenous people of Australia, who are of Aboriginal origin, Torres Strait Islander origin or both. They experience uneven heights of employment, education, and social disadvantages, which have led to poorer healthcare accessibility. Cultivating an environment with fortification from mental and physical abuse as well as offering chances for personal growth is all vital for an extended and blissful life.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;Who Are Indigenous People?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A nation comprises of a large number of people with solid links of identity. The national identity is characteristically founded on common religion, language, customs, or ethnicity. Indigenous people definition comprises the notions of first nations/people, tribes, ethnic groups, aboriginals, Jana jati, and Adivasi are all a part of a nation. Indigenous people differ from other citizens in that they symbolize a vast diversity of convictions, philosophies, dialects, customs, and histories. In addition, their notion of therapeutic differs from other citizens.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Indigenous Concept of Health and Healing</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are two types of sickness, physical and mental. Physical illness is caused by different kinds of toxins, accidents, and infectious diseases, whereas mental illness, is due to fear, anxiety, and anger among other emotional issues. Thus, health is an overall physical, social, and mental fitness and not simply the absence of frailty or illness. Indigenous people perceive health in a similar approach. They perceive it as the congruence that exists between people, societies, and the universe.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In various parts of the world, Western biomedical attention and traditional healing ways work hand in hand. For the indigenous population, however, due to their connection to the ancestral way of life, depends heavily on the customary ways of healing. In fact, almost 80% of the developing countries\' population has been projected to depend on traditional healing strategies as their prime source of health care.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are offering custom paper and essay sample online writing services.

Non-indigenous Australians tend to outlive Indigenous Australians and their death rates are half those of indigenous citizens.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Statistics</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For children born between 2010 and 2012, an indigenous girl has a life expectancy of 73.7 years, and the boy is likely to live to 69.1 years. For other citizens, a girl could live up to 83.1 while a boy up to 79.1 years.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Between 2007 and 2011, Indigenous Australians had advanced mortality rates in all age sets when paralleled to non-indigenous. Moreover, the 35-44 age set died at almost 5 times the non-indigenous rate.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Social Determinants of Indigenous Health</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Several aspects including the environments in which a person lives can affect one\'s health. Health social determinants are aspects that can have helpful and adverse impacts on the well-being of people and communities. Indigenous social health determinants include:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Housing&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A 2011 survey indicated that for indigenous Australians, the ratio of homelessness was 14 times that of non-indigenous. Additionally, 59% of Indigenous households were renters and 36% owners, compared with 29% and 68% of non-indigenous families.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Education</strong></em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In all learning institutions, indigenous students were significantly lesser than non-indigenous students. Approximately 49% of indigenous students continued schooling until the age of 12, compared with 81% of non-indigenous students.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Employment and income</strong></em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In 2011, 50% of indigenous people who exceeded 15 years had weekly revenue of less than $362 compared with $582 for non-indigenous people. Approximately 61% of non-indigenous people were working, compared with 42% of Indigenous. Indigenous Australians had an unemployment percentage rate of 17% compared with 5% for non-indigenous people.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Social determinants effect on health</strong></em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Indigenous Australians could assess health care better if they had better levels of education, incomes, and were homeowners. This could lessen the health gap between the indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Indigenous Health Gap</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There have been significant advancements in national Indigenous health policy, such as the assimilation of the Indigenous allied health Australia, to represent Torres Strait and Aboriginal allied health students and professional. However, Indigenous Australians continue to access poorer health services than non-Indigenous Australians.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Causes of the Gap</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Indigenous Burden of Disease Survey for Australia has established that the following behavioral risk aspects could explain the 49% of health gap:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n<li><em>Obesity (16%)</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Smoking (17%)</em></li>\r\n<li><em>High blood cholesterol (7%)</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Physical dormancy (12%)</em></li>\r\n<li><em>High blood pressure (6%)</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Alcohol (4%)</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Low consumption of fruit and vegetables (5%)</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Prohibited drug intake (4%)</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Juvenile sexual abuse (2%)</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Violence (3%)</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Unprotected sex</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The health gap continues to exist due to the failure of addressing the root causes. Other aspects that have widened the gap include:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Behavioral risk factors&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unsafe health behaviors like too much consumption of alcohol and smoking have widened the gap significantly. These unsafe behaviors are attributed to social disadvantages.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Access to health services</strong></em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Poor access to valuable health services has contributed towards the health gap. Some of the reasons that hinder indigenous Australians from getting health care include distance and transport concerns and lack of inexpensive services among others. Indigenous health issues can also be allied to the fact that children born into these families usually reside in remote places where governments don\'t capitalize on fundamental social services.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Changing Nature of Indigenous Health</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The movements to narrow the gap between the Torres Strait and Aboriginal health and other citizens are gaining popularity. The following are some of the organizations on the forefront of bridging the gap:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inala indigenous health service that aims at improving the wellbeing and health of Torres Strait and aboriginal people through a series of health, clinical promotion, and research activities</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Indigenous health conference that intends to reinforce life expectancy of indigenous people to be equivalent to that of non-indigenous Australians</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Institute for Urban Indigenous Health programs that strategize, cultivate and provide wide-ranging health care services to the South East Queensland Indigenous population</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The indigenous Australians have been marginalized for many years as discussed above. Although their concept of health and healing can be compared to the Western Biomedical health, social determinants have disadvantaged the indigenous Australians causing a noticeably wide health gap. However, with several organizations and programs emerging to close the gap, there is some light at the end of the tunnel.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a title=\"Order Your Essay Online\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">Order paper online</a> and get a professional writer to work on your paper.

A case study will analyze nearly every aspect of the subject\'s life and history to come up with findings on patterns and causes of behavior that can hopefully be generalized to many others.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some critics of the case study method believe that the study of a small number of cases is highly subjective and offers no grounds for generalizing results to a larger population. The main advantage of the case study writing is that you can focus on a particular case to provide more realistic responses that can generate a greater impact than a purely statistical survey.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Where Is It Used?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are different reasons for using case studies such as academic research purposes, corporate research and so on. The case study method is used to test whether specific scientific theories and models are practical in the real world. Depending on the purpose of your study, a case study can be used in an exploratory, explanatory or descriptive form. It has been used as a valid method of research in many fields such as business, marketing, legal, social sciences, medical, engineering and academic research. Case studies offer students the opportunity to interact with real-life situations and provide solutions to problems that can help them later in their careers.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Case Study Structure</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For one to write a successful case study that will earn you the good grades, you will need to follow specific guidelines, style, and format. The structure of writing a case study should be as follows:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Title</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Abstract.</strong>&nbsp;Summarize the paper for readers in a logical and easy to follow format.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Introduction.</strong>&nbsp;The introduction should include what you intend to talk about in the paper. Give an overview of the entire situation and identify key issues that project the problems defined in the case study. The real objective is to have the reader understand in a general sense why it is useful for them to read about the case and doesn\'t need to be more than a few paragraphs long.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Case Report.</strong>&nbsp;Here you need to describe the case study situation in detail, analyze the issues, identify for who the issue is a problem, consider possible alternatives by reviewing course readings, discussions, outside research and your experience and provide the best solution while supporting it with relevant evidence.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Discussion and Conclusion.</strong>&nbsp;In this section, we identify any questions that the case raises and summarize the lessons learned from the case. Ensure not to repeat the case history but give short and informative conclusions drawn from your analysis and assessment of the situation.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Acknowledgement.</strong>&nbsp;If anyone provided assistance with the drafting of the case study, it might be appropriate to thank them briefly.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>References.</strong>&nbsp;References that were used to support the case of study should be listed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Tables and Figures.</strong>&nbsp;Include tables and figures at the end of the manuscript.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Case Study Writing Tips</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Learning to write a case study is a continuous process that requires commitment, hard work, and discipline. When drafting your paper, you need to show your main center of study precisely and accurately. To help you with the case study writing process, here are some few tips that can contribute to improving your technical writing skills and make way to compelling case studies.</p>\r\n<p>1. Read the case carefully and conduct a profound case study research before your writing. You need to understand the case, make notes and highlight relevant facts and key issues.</p>\r\n<p>2. Identify the problem, learn the cause of the problem and how to solve that problem.</p>\r\n<p>3. Choose a title that captures your reader\'s attention and focuses on results.</p>\r\n<p>4. If the case contains large amounts of data, analyze the data to draw up relevant patterns or trends.</p>\r\n<p>5. If the case describes a company\'s history, find the key issues and correlate to how they may have impacted the current situation.</p>\r\n<p>6. Stick with the facts given in the case as well as established facts about the context when drawing your conclusions. Don\'t give personalized views or opinions.</p>\r\n<p>7.

It results whenever harmful gasses, smoke, or dust enters the atmosphere and in turn, hinders the survival of animals and plants as the air contains toxic substances.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The survival of human beings and animals greatly depend on the combination of gasses in the atmosphere; slight disruption of this composition can cause devastating effects on their existence. An imbalance in these atmospheric gasses is known to result in global warming, a great threat to the contemporary world. We cannot underestimate the effects air pollution has on the ozone layer which largely contributes to the existence of organisms on the planet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Causes of Air Pollution</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the causes of air pollution to be well articulated, it is important to delve into the types of air pollutants. Air pollutants can be caused by secondary and primary sources. If a process directly results to pollution, then this forms the primary source. For instance, factories emit&nbsp;sulfur&nbsp;dioxide which is a primary source of air pollution. Reactions and interactions between primary sources&nbsp;form&nbsp;the secondary pollutant. For instance, the intermingling of primary pollutants forms smog which is a secondary pollutant.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 10px auto 10px auto;\" title=\"Main Causes of Air Pollution\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/air-pollution-causes.jpg\" alt=\"Main Causes of Air Pollution\" width=\"650\" height=\"590\" /></p>\r\n<h4><strong>Burning of fossil fuels<br /></strong></h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The main cause of air pollution is burning of coal, gasoline, petroleum, and other fossil fuels. These fuels are the main cause of acid rain, smog, greenhouse gas emissions, and presence of heavy metals in the air.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fossil fuels form an important part of the society; they are used in transportation, heating, manufacturing, and even in electricity generation. This makes them an important part of the society making it difficult (but not uncontrollable) to curtail. In modern society, the use of fossil fuels can be made so that its burning becomes efficient, but this comes with a monetary cost. It is important to note that unless alternative cleaner option is found, we will have the future facing the same problems of pollution.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Increased use of motor vehicles, and emission of nitrogen<br /></strong></h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vehicles use fuel which sometimes is not completely burnt in the engine; therefore, they release VOCs (Volatile Organic Chemicals) into the air. VOCs and nitrogen are a common source of air pollution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Decomposition of garbage and solid wastes</strong></h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Disposal sites containing biodegradable substances are known to emit methane gas into the atmosphere. Methane gas is known to be a harmful gas, it is highly flammable and a potential disaster to the ozone layer. Garbage and other household products release VOCs to the air.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Natural causes</strong></h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Air pollution can come from natural sources such as dust, wildfires, and volcanic activity. Wildfire is known to emit VOCs and particulates into the atmosphere. Volcanic eruptions spew sulfur dioxide and volcanic ash into the atmosphere. Volcanic ash is usually dumped in the upper atmosphere, and as a result, global temperatures are lowered. However, pollution resulting from natural causes remains in the atmosphere for a short period and does not result in a permanent change as it might be the case with human activity-based pollution.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Effects of Air Pollution</h3>\r\n<p><em style=\"color: #800000; font-size: 1em; text-align: justify;\"><img style=\"margin: 10px auto; display: block;\" title=\"Air Pollution Consequences\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/air-pollution-consequences.jpg\" alt=\"Air pollution consequences\" width=\"650\" height=\"315\" /></em></p>\r\n<h4>1. Respiratory infections</h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Air pollution is the leading cause of respiratory diseases. Exposure to air pollutants can cause lung cancer and even asthma. Asthma can lead to death if not well treated, as it might cause difficulty in breathing. A prolonged exposure of pollutants can cause lung cancer.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Global warming</h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The rise in sea level, rising temperature in the world, and the melting of ice glaciers are the evidence for the global warming. Global warming is a direct effect of air pollution in the world. The only way to curb this increasingly destructive menace is to reduce air pollution.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Depletion of ozone layer</h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the greenhouse effect which is the major contributor of the release of chlorofluorocarbon into the atmosphere has led to the depletion of ozone layer. This layer is important in shielding the earth from the destructive ultraviolet (UV) radiations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Formation of acid rain</h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Emission of harmful gasses such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen into the atmosphere lead to the formation of acid rain. It is quite common for rain water to have sulfuric acid due to rampant cases of air pollution in the modern society. Acid rain is a major threat to the aquatic life as well as human beings.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are carcinogenic substances in the acid rain, and it has devastating effects to even metal which can be observed by the extent of corrosion that often results.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. Eutrophication</h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Air pollutants such as nitrogen oxide speed up the growth of algae on the water surface. This growth competes with aquatic life for oxygen, therefore, posing a major threat to fishing. The only way to reduce the devastating effects of air pollution will be to come up with effective ways of reducing air pollution.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Earth\'s atmosphere has a self-regulating mechanism that ensures sequestration of carbon among other pollutants. The mechanism works to ensure that the ecosystem is not affected by the changes occurring in the atmosphere. However, if people continue to add more pollutants than the earth is able to remove, then the response will be increased smog, acid rain, global warming and a number of health problems.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you need any assistance with your essay writing you can contact our friendly support team and we will gladly help you or you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">place on order</a>&nbsp;and our professionals will write a great paper for you.</p>','Cause and Effect Essay Example: Air Pollution Poignant Matters','','publish','closed','closed','','cause-and-effect-essay-free-example','','','2017-12-14 13:17:36','2017-12-14 11:17:36','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(456,1,'2016-08-23 16:22:20','2016-08-23 13:22:20','','cause_and_effect_eesay_air_pollution_ozessay','','inherit','closed','closed','','cause_and_effect_eesay_air_pollution_ozessay','','','2017-12-14 13:17:36','2017-12-14 11:17:36','',455,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/images/article/og/cause_and_effect_eesay_air_pollution_ozessay.jpg?v=1495698042',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(457,1,'2016-08-22 18:39:18','2016-08-22 15:39:18','<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Chuck Norris Approves!</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you have never used an essay or <a title=\"Article Writing\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/article-writing\">article writing service</a> before and you\'ve been searching for one then look no further.

After all, the quality of persuasive writing is often a product of the topic itself. If your chosen topic doesn\'t have a compelling argument to it, you won\'t be able to produce a compelling argument in your paper, no matter how well you write.</p>\r\n<p>Here is a guide to deciphering the quality of persuasive writing topics, so that you\'ll always come up with a high-quality persuasive argument.</p>\r\n<h2>A Strong Persuasive Essay Topic Has Two Strong Sides</h2>\r\n<p>In the writing (and arguing) fields, there\'s a name for propping up a weak defense to oppose, making your job easier. It\'s called <strong>a strawman argument</strong>, and it weakens the overall quality of your essay.</p>\r\n<blockquote>For example, no one wants to read a paper in which you state \"vegetables are healthy\". This is a generally well-known fact, and any counter argument you could defend against would be a strawman.</blockquote>\r\n<p>You want to pick only persuasive essay topics that have two strong sides from which to choose. These are usually issues that aren\'t agreed upon, even in modern society. Some examples would be:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Capitalism only protects the interests of the rich</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Standardized tests are good judge of intellect</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These are issues that are often debated&nbsp;because the arguments surrounding them are compelling.</p>\r\n<h2>Most Good Persuasive Topics Take Research to Support Your Side</h2>\r\n<p>There are some exceptions to this, namely when the topic is purely philosophical, and the essay involves a simple opinionated statement and support, but most persuasive topics take some research and evidence to support your statement of opinion.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Here are some examples:</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">1. If your topic statement is \'<em>The Modern Education System Is Failing Students\'</em>, you wouldn\'t just want to state why you think this is true. The best way to persuade is to compile evidence. Stats about how grades are dropping nationwide, or how high school grads are increasingly unprepared for higher education would be better evidence than your opinion.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">2. Historical persuasive essay writing topics follow the same rules. If you\'re, for example, arguing that the <em>United States was never really \"the land of opportunity\"</em>, you could argue that minorities in early American history weren\'t given their fair chance at success, rather than simply saying it\'s true because that\'s the&nbsp;way you feel.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/persuasive-essay-writing-service\">PERSUASIVE ESSAY WRITING SERVICE</a></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Even when picking from a list of good persuasive writing topics for a school assignment, undoubtedly some will be stronger than others, and as a result, some will give your writing more potential.</p>\r\n<p>So how can you recognize some really compelling persuasive writing essay topics? A topic with a lot of argument surrounding it is better than one that\'s generally agreed upon, and a topic that necessitates research and statistics as evidence is generally more effective than a simple opinion statement.</p>\r\n<p>Now that you know the recipe for success, you can get started generating your own great topics for persuasive writing!</p>','Persuasive Writing Topics','','publish','closed','closed','','persuasive-writing-topics','','','2017-08-10 14:46:30','2017-08-10 11:46:30','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(460,1,'2016-11-19 08:39:29','2016-11-19 06:39:29','','150-topics-for-your-persuasive-essay-v4','','inherit','closed','closed','','150-topics-for-your-persuasive-essay-v4','','','2017-08-10 14:46:30','2017-08-10 11:46:30','',459,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/150-topics-for-your-persuasive-essay-v4.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(461,1,'2016-08-29 10:30:22','2016-08-29 07:30:22','<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">What Is an Expository Essay</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">An <a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/expository-essay\">expository essay</a> is a type of essay writing that involves substantiating the idea with facts, and presenting a written argument that is clear and compelling.

Whatever the reason might be, there is a way to get where you want to be in no time at all. It all starts by having the will and the attitude to never give up and keep on fighting. To help you along the way, there are a few simple things that you can do.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;<img style=\"display: block; margin: 5px auto 5px auto;\" title=\"Never-Give-Up-Person\" src=\"https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/never-give-up-guy.jpg\" alt=\"Never give up person\" width=\"650\" height=\"541\" /></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">TIP 1. Push forward</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The first step to reaching your goals is to stay alive. So long as you are still alive, you stand a chance at being able to do anything you want. No one can stop you from striving to do all of the things you want to do in life when you are alive and able to move about. The only time someone should be able to stop you from becoming the person you want to be is if you are no longer here. Don\'t allow someone to talk you out of your dreams and aspirations. Take control and keep pushing forward to get where you want to be in life. It is only a matter of time.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">TIP 2. Set your expectations a little lower</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Oftentimes, people set their expectations so high that there is no way they can ever meet them. Most people who are successful aren\'t successful overnight. It takes a lot of time and patience to get where you want to be. Most of the stories that you hear about someone making it big overnight are the result of good marketing tactics and nothing more. While some of the stories could be true, there is often more to it than what you are being told.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Don\'t try to guess how someone became successful. Focus on doing what you need to in order to achieve your dreams and goals. Very few people will achieve success so quickly. If you expect to turn into an overnight sensation, you are going to wind up disappointing yourself and feeling even more depressed when things don\'t turn out that way. Instead of setting yourself up for failure, consider giving yourself goals that you can achieve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">TIP 3. You are stronger than you give yourself credit for</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Oftentimes, people find themselves struggling to handle things. They think the pressure is just too much for them to bear. Don\'t give in to the pressure. If you keep doing the same things and not getting results, you can expect that you are going to keep failing. You have to experiment with different things and angles. As long as you keep trying different things, you are bound to end up succeeding at some point in time along the way. Keep persevering and you will eventually find what works.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">TIP 4. Fake it a little</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">At some point in time or another, just about everyone has faked how successful they are. There is no reason why you can\'t do the same thing. You don\'t need to go out there and start lying about what you have achieved, but that you can act like you are already successful. When you act successful, it changes the way you view the world as a whole. It helps you to strive to be more successful and achieve the things you want in life. Having the right mindset can go a long way in becoming the entrepreneur you want to be.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">TIP 5. Stop comparing yourself to someone who is already successful</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Just because you know someone who is doing amazing, that doesn\'t mean that you know the specifics behind their story. You don\'t know what it is really like for them. Even when you think you know everything, you don\'t. Allowing yourself to get sucked into the whole mess will only end up causing you to struggle. When you are at your lowest, you end up taking a lot of risks because you figure you have nothing to lose. It is at that point that you are probably going to end up taking your biggest leap of faith and end up succeeding.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This small dip often comes right before you are successful and hit it big. If you never hit your low point, how can you possibly appreciate the high points that are coming your way? No one just walks into an overnight success. You have to continue taking risks and striving to reach your goal. Otherwise, you will never get where you want to be in life.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">By following the tips above, you can be successful. It is all a matter of saying to yourself, \"I will never give up.\" When you are able to get into the right mindset, you can truly achieve anything you want in life. Don\'t beat yourself up if it doesn\'t happen overnight. With enough time, patience and a willingness to keep on persevering, you will get where you want to be in no time at all. You are in complete control of your destiny. Make it a good one.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<style type=\"text/css\"><!--\r\n<g class=\"gr_ gr_112 gr-alert gr_spell gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"112\" data-gr-id=\"112\">td</g> {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-<a href=\"placement:same-cell;}--\">placement:same-cell;}--</a>>\r\n--></style>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you need any assistance with your essay writing you can contact our friendly support team and we will gladly help you or you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/order\">place an order</a>&nbsp;and our professionals will write a great paper for you.</p>','Expository Essay Example: 5 Tips to Become a Never-Give-Up Person','','publish','closed','closed','','custom-essay/expository-essay/free-example','','','2017-05-13 14:42:08','2017-05-13 11:42:08','',0,'',0,'page','',0),(462,1,'2016-08-29 10:30:22','2016-08-29 07:30:22','','expository-essay-example4-v3','','inherit','closed','closed','','expository-essay-example4-v3','','','2017-05-13 14:42:08','2017-05-13 11:42:08','',461,'https://ozessay-a.akamaihd.net/content/3/en/images/articles/expository-essay-example4-v3.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpg',0),(463,1,'2017-03-21 13:13:11','2017-03-21 11:13:11','<p>Assignment writing is a task that every student in Australia faces at some point of their student career.

Here\'s how you can get help from professional writers who are standing by to guide you in your assignments, and into your career.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Consult a Professional Writing Service</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You might not think <a title=\"Our Writers\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/our-writers\">writers-for-hire</a> could be that useful when you get out of your basic university courses, but if the company is worth their salt, they\'ll have writers who specialize in all subjects at all levels. Here are some ways a professional writing service can help you get your feet on the ground in any professional program:</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">You Can Do Your Own Writing With Help</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, as a lawyer, you won\'t be able to get help with your briefs and other writings, but as a student, it may be difficult to get a feel for the specific tone of most law assignments and legal documents.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The experts at a reputable professional writing service can help you with as much as you need, whether that means writing a few assignments for you so you can understand what you need to do to succeed, or editing your law assignments so that you can get the best marks possible.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">A Writing Service Takes Some of the Strain Away from Law School</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For many students, law school is unlike anything they\'ve ever encountered. After all, most law students end up graduating and working long hours in the beginning, so law school is a way to prepare them for an enormous workload.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A professional writing service is just what you need to take some of the stress out of your workload. You\'ll get law <a title=\"Assignment Writing Help\" href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/assignment-writing-help\">assignment help</a> and a guaranteed recipe for success from experts who have been where you are.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">A Team of Writers-for-Hire Can Help With Any Advanced Level Program</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, don\'t just think that a writing service can only help overwhelmed law students. Aside from offering help with law assignment, writing services offer students accounting assignment help, and assistance in many other demanding professional courses, such as nursing assignments, marketing assignment help, and maths assignments.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why OZessay?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When you\'re bogged down by the constant stress of law school or some other demanding professional program, there\'s only one company in Australia you can turn to for reliable solutions.

Likewise, the definition of ghostwriter is similar in nature: ghostwriters create fiction and non-fiction books, essays and articles, as well as songs, screenplays and many other kinds of writing. They do not sign their own name to the work; it is generally attributed to someone else &ndash; either the person who has hired them or their representative. Summing up, whenever you hear the question &lsquo;what is ghost writer&rsquo;, you should know that this is someone who does some writing on behalf of someone else and is usually paid for it.</p>\r\n<h2>When to Use a Ghost Writer</h2>\r\n<p>There are some areas in which ghostwriting is common. Politicians and celebrities, for example, frequently use professional ghost writers for memoirs, important speeches, social media posts and other forms of writing for the general public. US President Donald Trump in his memoir, The Art of the Deal, worked \"with\" Tony Schwartz. The \'with\' or \'as told to\' attribution generally means the secondary person, the ghostwriter, actually wrote the book.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.ozessay.com.au/essay-writer\">ESSAY WRITER: HIRING WRITERS AT OZESSAY</a></h4>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>However, anyone can use a ghost writer for any reason &ndash; they are common in business, the music and film industries, and for individual and company biographies.</p>\r\n<p>Here are some of the types of projects that might benefit from the skills of a ghostwriter:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>White papers &ndash; these are authoritative reports published by companies who wish to offer subscribers or visitors to their website comprehensive information about a particular subject or area.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Eulogies, best man, and other special occasion speeches &ndash; do not necessarily have to be written by the person who will deliver them. For these meaningful moments, ghostwriting is acceptable and helpful.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Adapting a novel to a screenplay &ndash; often the original author\'s name remains on the movie even though their idea has been significantly re-worked by other writers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Copy for a company website &ndash; often, text in the form of blog posts or page copy is created by a ghostwriter that has nothing to do with the company whose website it is. This type of text, known as content marketing, is increasingly a feature of doing business online.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Why Use a Ghost Writer?</h2>\r\n<p>Ghost writers can come in handy if the person commissioning the work is not actually a very good writer. They may have an amazing story to tell, but don\'t have the skills to formulate it in readable prose. Or, they not have the time available to labour over a manuscript.</p>\r\n<p>In other instances, they might be an excellent writer&nbsp;but are well known for a particular genre of writing. They may ghostwrite work under another name when they wish to experiment with a new style or genre.</p>\r\n<p>A music artist who has a way with beats may not have a way with words. It is common practice in the music industry for lyrics to a song to be supplied to a ghostwriter or even a team of them. Hip-hop singer Meek Mill recently called out Drake for using ghostwriters on hit songs with his own name on them. It led to a high-profile spat on social media, but the practice is very common &ndash; it\'s just not often talked about.</p>\r\n<p>In the business and tech industries, technical language can be a barrier to comprehension by the general layperson. It is not uncommon for a well-rounded ghost writer to work with an engineer, scientist or CEO to construct documents that are full of information, but still readable for a mainstream public.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes ghostwriting is simply about non-attribution. In the forties, acclaimed American screenwriter Dalton Trumbo was unable to put his own name on scripts for hit movies such as Roman Holiday and The Brave One, due to blacklisting by a government agency investigating him for alleged Communist activities. He wrote as Ian McClellan Hunter.</p>\r\n<p>The moral of this story is &ndash; ghost writers aren\'t all hacks. Some of them are the finest writers around.</p>\r\n<h2>Top 5 Tips for Working with a Ghost Writer</h2>\r\n<p><strong>TIP 1.</strong> <strong>Clarify your thoughts before beginning. </strong></p>\r\n<p>Create an outline, or work on one with the ghost writer, that includes major chapter headings or sections. At the very least define how the document will begin and end, and list a few things that must be included in between.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIP 2.</strong> <strong>Communicate openly about who does what and how you will work together. </strong></p>\r\n<p>There are as many ways to work as there are individuals. Will you dictate your thoughts? Provide written notes? Edit the ghostwriter\'s initial draft &ndash; or vice versa?</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIP 3. Be patient.</strong></p>\r\n<p>It may take the ghostwriter a while to understand your material and establish a voice.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIP 4.</strong> <strong>Don\'t expect to keep your relationship a secret. </strong></p>\r\n<p>If your\'s is a good project, the ghost writer will naturally want to mention it somewhere. Decide to what degree you are comfortable with this. It may be that you need to include a non-disclosure clause in your contract with them.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIP 5.</strong> <strong>At its best, ghostwriting can help you realize a work that otherwise might not exist. </strong></p>\r\n<p>But when you and the ghost writer have finished your work, let it go &ndash; it may be your story, but once the piece is finished it\'s in the public realm and is no longer yours (and your ghostwriter\'s) alone.</p>\r\n<h2>GhostWriting as a Service at OZessay</h2>\r\n<p>OZessay offers ghostwriting services for both book writing as well as academic research.

But narrative writing can be easily referred to non-fiction, that latter being a story based on real facts. In the case when we consider narrative writing to be non-fiction it should be a true story, a biography.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each type of academic writing has its purpose. Students learn to express their thoughts and ideas in a logical manner. What is the purpose of narrative writing? The main aim is to master the art of storytelling. Writing a narrative essay you understand better your feeling and emotions experienced, entertain your readers and learn how to write an essay.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A lot of people confuse narrative and descriptive. Let&rsquo;s see the difference between descriptive and narrative writing. Unlike a narrative essay which is personal experience story, a descriptive essay is about some particular place, event or person. It doesn&rsquo;t tell any story.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Tell Your Personal Story</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Follow the rules for narrative writing. OZessay writers have prepared a short information on writing an essay. Read it carefully to get your narrative writing stimulus.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Need to tell your story? Here are key features of narrative writing:</p>\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Avoid using complex words. Your story should be clear for the reader.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.</strong> There&rsquo;s no necessity to describe every of your steps and movements.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Write only about your own experience.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Let your story be dynamic. Use the same words and phrases as you would use in your speech when telling the same story.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5.</strong> Don&rsquo;t use too many references. If it\'s possible to cite a helpful source, do it in a list of references.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6.</strong> Don&rsquo;t forget about the narrative writing prompts. Ask yourself what you would like to write about. Your response will give you a topic.</p>\r\n<p><strong>7.</strong> One more important thing to bear in mind when writing is to include 5 elements of narrative writing into your story:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">A plot is a whole story from the beginning to the end, it is what happens with the characters. Conflict is usually referred to the plot and is a kind of fight between the forces.</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">A setting is a time and area the story takes place in.</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">Characters are divided into two types and called protagonists and antagonists. Typically, a protagonist is the main and positive hero. An antagonist is opposed to a protagonist and is considered to be negative or quite different from the protagonist.</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">A theme is a central idea around which everything happens.</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">A point of view is a final opinion that can be told by the 1st person narrator or the 3rd person narrator.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>8. Techniques of narrative writing known also as literary devices will make all types of narrative writing more interesting and exciting. They include imagery, alliteration, hyperbole, symbolism, humor etc.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Outline Your Text</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As any other types of essays, a narrative essay has its structure. Narrative writing structure is as follows:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First is an orientation that tells the readers what the story will be about, introduces the characters and the scene of the events.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Then goes the main body of the story which includes the complication and climax. The development of complication sets the sequence of exciting events and the climax is a peak of rising actions.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The final part of narrative writing is a resolution which means the aftermath of the story.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Let Your Story Be Interesting</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are looking for some narrative writing topics here are some personal narrative writing ideas you may use to create your topic:</p>\r\n<p>- Sometimes life gives choices. Write if you had a time when your choice was too difficult and how you got over it.</p>\r\n<p>- Fears are a part of growing up. Write about your greatest fear ever and how you have overcome it.</p>\r\n<p>- Changes in life are inevitable. Write about a period of your life when you changed greatly.</p>\r\n<p>- Write about the largest risk you have ever taken.</p>\r\n<p>- Write a time in your life when you were stressed out and how you have combatted the stress.</p>\r\n<p>- Write about your favorite teacher and how he/she inspired you.</p>\r\n<p>- Write about a time when you understood that social media influenced you.</p>\r\n<p>- Write about your everyday problems that bother you. Are there any solutions?</p>\r\n<p>- Write about a period of your life when you started living on your own.</p>\r\n<p>- Write about the things you would like to change in your life.</p>\r\n<p>Let this article be a narrative writing stimulus for you.

This style of writing is used to inform the reader, present results of research or get the reader involved into a scholarly discussion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Just like other formal styles of writing, it has a set of rules and best practices that must be followed to meet academic standards of writing and to be accepted by the academic community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Here is what makes academic writing different from other writing genres:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Audience</h3>\r\n<p>There are three main audience types that work with academic writing: students, professors (instructors, advisors etc) and professional researchers. Professors give students respective writing assignments while the latter work on them to demonstrate their knowledge and the skills acquired in the writing process. Professional researchers, in turn, generate academic content to talk to fellow scholars, present their research findings and discuss results.</p>\r\n<h3>Background knowledge</h3>\r\n<p>Academic audiences already have some background knowledge about the subject in discussion. Any other audience would have a hard time understanding academic writing that abounds in jargon, professionalisms, and terms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Tone</h3>\r\n<p>The overall writing style should be formal and impersonal. Using impersonal constructions like Passive Voice or speaking from the 3rd person is usually encouraged to ensure objective tone. Please refer to &lsquo;phrases to use in academic writing&rsquo; section of this paper.</p>\r\n<h3>Use of Evidence</h3>\r\n<p>Reference to evidence is another tool that assists academic writers to achieve objectivity and attain. When writing academic papers, an author should refer to objective evidence (research findings, data etc) to sound impersonal and objective.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Please refer to the table below for a brief summary of the four distinctive features:</p>\r\n<table style=\"height: 96px; width: 722px;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr style=\"height: 17.5313px;\">\r\n<td style=\"width: 224px; height: 17.5313px;\"><strong>Audience</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 496px; height: 17.5313px;\">Students, instructors or researchers</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\r\n<td style=\"width: 224px; height: 17px;\"><strong>Background knowledge</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 496px; height: 17px;\">Audience has background knowledge about the subject under discussion</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\r\n<td style=\"width: 224px; height: 17px;\"><strong>Tone</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 496px; height: 17px;\">Formal, impersonal (usually 3d person is used)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\r\n<td style=\"width: 224px; height: 17px;\"><strong>Evidence</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 496px; height: 17px;\">Statements be backed up with research or evidence</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><strong>Table 1.</strong> Distinctive features of the academic style of writing</p>\r\n<h2>Basic Academic Writing Guide from OZessay</h2>\r\n<p>Writing scholarly papers - both for educational and research purposes - requires solid academic writing skills. The good news is that just like muscles, these skills can be built up via exercise. Our concise guide below contains all the basic exercise required for successful academic writing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NOTE:&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Every university or college will most likely offer their own academic writing guide. These guides are very similar in their essence, yet they differ in the type of detail they contain. Always make sure you obtain and closely follow the writing guide of your institution.</em></p>\r\n<h3>1. Eliminate personal language.&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Use of personal pronouns, especially first person, is strongly discouraged. They can make your paper too subjective and we try to avoid that for objectivity reasons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Example with a </strong>personal<strong> pronoun:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>I believe that&hellip;, I found that&hellip;., we hope that&hellip;, I strongly consider&hellip; etc.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> In this paper, I intend to argue in support of the claim that self-paced learning shows higher efficiency and better results</p>\r\n<p><strong>Example using impersonal language:</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>The paper covers the problem of&hellip;, there exists a generally accepted theory that&hellip;, the project focuses on etc.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> The paper will argue in support of the claim that self-paced learning shows higher efficiency and better results.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Use passive voice to maintain objective tone.&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p><em>It is considered that&hellip;, it is thought that&hellip;, it is argued that&hellip;, the concept of &hellip;. is widespread</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> It will be argued that self-paced learning shows high efficiency and better results.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Relate to your research results, not your feeling/beliefs</h3>\r\n<p><em>The article suggests&hellip;, the data shows that&hellip;, research indicates&hellip;, raw data shows&hellip;, according to&hellip; etc.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> The article by Smith &amp; Johnson (2017) suggests that self-paced learning has higher efficiency and better results compared to conventional learning.</p>\r\n<h2>Phrases to Use and to Avoid in Academic Writing</h2>\r\n<table style=\"height: 110px; width: 722px;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr style=\"height: 13.4375px;\">\r\n<td style=\"width: 386px; height: 13.4375px;\"><strong>Phrases to&nbsp;avoid</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 332px; height: 13.4375px;\"><strong>Phrases to use</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height: 13px;\">\r\n<td style=\"width: 386px; height: 13px;\">I believe</td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 332px; height: 13px;\">It is considered that</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height: 13px;\">\r\n<td style=\"width: 386px; height: 13px;\">I think</td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 332px; height: 13px;\">The results indicate (that)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height: 13px;\">\r\n<td style=\"width: 386px; height: 13px;\">I am sure that</td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 332px; height: 13px;\">Considering the results</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height: 13px;\">\r\n<td style=\"width: 386px; height: 13px;\">I am convinced that</td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 332px; height: 13px;\">According to the figures,&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"height: 13px;\">\r\n<td style=\"width: 386px; height: 13px;\">It is my belief that</td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 332px; height: 13px;\">The research indicates/suggests (that)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><strong>Table 1.</strong> Phrases to avoid in academic writing &amp; phrases to use</p>\r\n<h2>How to Write an Academic Essay</h2>\r\n<p>Our website contains information about different types of essays, simple and clear.

We have put together the most common mistakes in academic writing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Incorrect sentences. We recommend checking if every sentence you write can stand alone and bear a single complete thought.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Sprawling sentences. Make sure you do not sprawl the sentences as it is hard to read and understand them.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Academic writing connecting words and modifiers. Make sure you use correct connecting words that arrange your thoughts in a logical manner. Place the modifiers near the words and phrases they modify.</li>\r\n<li>Incorrect parallelism. To express 2 or more matching thoughts, use grammatically equal phrases.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Missed commas. Put commas to express the connections between the sentence elements.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Faulty apostrophes. Learn the writing rules of the possessive case of nouns and contractions such as it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s and so on.</li>\r\n<li>Confused words. Learn the most confused word in the English language.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Misspelled words. Consult a dictionary if you don&rsquo;t know how to write a particular word.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>How Can You Learn Fast the Rules of Academic Writing?&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>There are various ways to study academic writing structure and style. You may study thoroughly this type of writing at college or university. You can take IELTS academic writing course; or order some example of academic essay writing from a trusted company and sort every part of the essay out with a professional writer.
